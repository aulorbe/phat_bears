[{"name": "032 Chunk", "bio": "32 Chunk July 2021 NPS photo Adult Male Year First Identified: 2007 as a subadult male, has since reach adulthood Year Last Observed: 2023 Known Offspring Of: Not known at this time Genetics Study Samples Obtained: 32 Chunk was successfully darted by Ranger Michael Saxton in October 2017 for the genetics study. In 2012, 32 Chunk was identified as a young, medium sized male. His coat was medium brown and had darker spots around his neck and shoulders. A scar above his right eye, as well as his large hindquarters were distinctive features at that time. In 2014 and 2015, 32 Chunk was described as a young, medium-large male. In early summer, his coat was medium --brown, and he would shed the fur on his shoulders first. 32 often had numerous small scars and wounds around his neck and face. In the fall, his coat was uniform medium to dark brown. In all seasons, he appeared to carry more weight in his hind quarters than in front which gave 32 a distinctive silhouette. He lacked a prominent shoulder hump. In 2016, 32 Chunk was described as a large adult male. In early summer, his coat is medium-brown and he sheds the fur on his shoulders first. He has numerous small scars and wounds around his neck and face. His ears are distinctly pointed, and he has a prominent brow. In the fall, his coat is a uniform medium to dark brown. In all seasons, he appears to carry more weight in his hind quarters than in front which gives 32 a distinctive silhouette. He lacks a prominent shoulder hump. Resident Naturalist with Explore, Mike Fitz created this Meet Bear 32 Chunk video Can a brown bear be dominant, patient, and even playful at the same time? For at least one adult male at Brooks River, the answer is yes. Chunk is a large adult male with narrowly-set eyes and a prominent brow ridge. Even at his leanest, Chunk carries substantial fat reserves, especially on his hind quarters. He tends to shed much of the fur around his shoulders and neck. This gives him a two-toned appearance and exposes numerous scars and wounds.: Meet Bear 32 Chunk - Bears of Brooks Falls by Explore's Resident Naturalist Mike Fitz In 2012, 32 Chunk remained subordinate to most other bears, and was often begging or scavenging fish scraps. When fishing, he would often stand up to get a better view. He had been observed fishing the falls and the lower river. 32 was one of the few bears in the Brooks Camp area during June 2012, so he was an early season bear even back then. In 2014, it was noted that 32 Chunk had become increasingly dominant along the river, behavior that continued into 2017. In 2014 and 2015, he was subordinate to only the largest adult males at Brooks Falls (ex: 856, 747, 814 Lurch). 32 was still observed sometimes attempting to steal fish from other bears. From 2014 through 2017, 32 continued to fish the falls and the lower river. At Brooks Falls, he usually fished the far pool, but would sometimes fish the jacuzzi when other more dominant bears are not present. When fishing, he still often stood up to get a better view. 32 Chunk continued to be an early season arriver, sometimes seen in the Brooks River area in May and June. The 2015 Bears of Brooks River Book says to look for 32 to become increasingly dominant as he grows over the next few years. In 2021, #32 continued to be one of the most dominant bears on the river. Despite this, it is not uncommon to also see him patiently wait to scavenge leftovers. He returned in July with a large gash across his muzzle. While we do not know how he got this scar, many large males often accrue scars as a result of vying for mating opportunities. 2007: 32 Chunk was first identified as a subadult in 2007, but has since reached adulthood. 2007.07.01: Ranger Jeanne's 07/01/2007 photo of 32 Chunk on her flickr page. 2008.07.25.

This play fight last for nearly 20 minutes. Young, well fed bears that are tolerant of one another will often play flight. This play mimics the motions of real fighting between bears. These young males are ascending the bear hierarchy each summer. It is quite possible that they will be fighting for real over fish or females in the next few years. KNP&P video: 32 Chunk and 89 Backpack play fight 09 12 2014 video by KNP&P Cam viewer and KNP volunteer Stacey commented on KNP's video of 32 Chunk and 89 Backpack playing on 3/14/2021. \"Happy 32 Chunk Day! When I started watching the cams, in 2013, the first bear I fell in love with was 89 Backpack. And, at the time, 89's BFF was 32 Chunk! The two bears were similar in age and size -- and (although it's hard to believe now) they were very similar in temperament. The first few years I watched, it seemed that 89 and 32 were ALWAYS playfighting. ALWAYS! It was like they never ate -- they just wanted to playfight. And unlike 503 Cubadult, they weren't playing with everyone -- in my mind, they only playfought with each other. We'd frequently see them playfighting on the BF cam. But I remember vividly the first time I saw this video, which someone (maybe Mike Fitz or Ranger Jeanne?) recorded from the LR platform. The first time I watched it, I kept hitting the audio button -- because it seemed like someone had hit \"mute.\" I couldn't believe that 2,000 pounds of bear could interact with each other so completely silently. And now, whenever I see bears playfighting, I think of how silent those playfights are. Over the years, 89 Backpack and 32 Chunk have grown into quite different bears. 89 Backpack is a lover, not a fighter; while 32 Chunk has dreams (at least sometimes) of wearing the crown. I'm so glad I met 32 Chunk in his \"early\" days, when he was palling around w/89.\" 9/12/2014 video by JoeBear and comment by him, \"Backpack and Chunk wrestling in a video taken by Katmai National Park Rangers.

The 32 Chunk & 474 Fight from the Riffles Cam 2017-09-09, video by Birgitt 19:46:Mike Fitz comments about the fight between 474 and 32 Chunk: \"These events provide another opportunity for us to contemplate competition and toughness of brown bears. The hierarchy on the river has shuffled again with more large adult males using the falls at the same time. I visited Brooks Camp earlier this week and was able to see 747, 474, and 32 Chunk. When I was at the river, these bears were usually separated in time and space. I didn\u2019t see them commingle much at all, except for one interaction between 747 and 474 where 474 appeared to avoid the approach of 747. Based on that and videos of 32, 4747, and 747 from the bearcams, here\u2019s the hierarchy as I currently see it:747 > 474 > 32 68 is also very large and quite capable of maintaining access to fishing spots along with the largest adult males. However, I did not witness him interacting with 32, 474, or 747 so I am unsure where he sits in the hierarchy. It\u2019s reasonable to assume, based on his size alone, that he ranks at least as high as 32. 474 \u201cwon\u201d the fight with 32 from my perspective. 32 appeared to encroach on 474\u2019s space, even lunging toward 474. Instead of yielding, 474 decided to physically engage 32 and he quickly gained the advantage, biting into 32\u2019s shoulder hump. 474 then disengaged, slowly moving away to fish, while 32 sat still and watched him. Fights like this remind me of the toughness of bears. If a human were in 32\u2019s place, he or she may have likely received life threatening injuries, but 32 Chunk just walked away. In fact, he seemed to show no outward signs of injury when he walked under the cam afterward.See LaniH's snapshot here Intense fights among bears at Brooks Falls are relatively rare in early summer and even more so in late summer and fall when salmon can be scavenged throughout the lower half of Brooks River. This year silver (coho) salmon appear to be more abundant than average (nearly every salmon I saw bears catch at the falls was a silver salmon). Silver salmon are usually larger than the more abundant sockeye salmon and their run is later in the summer so right now they are probably richer in calories than the sockeyes who have spent weeks in fresh water without eating. Fishing at the falls now may give bears even more opportunities to get fat. As we\u2019ve witnessed, fishing in close proximity to your competitors though is risky. 32 Chunk\u2019s reign at the very top of the hierarchy was short lived. However, he remains a very large adult male, one of the fattest on the river. While he seem to have free reign in July and August, he now faces stiffer and more challenging competitors this fall.\" When Mike Fitz was asked: \"How often during your time at Brooks did you see another adult male like Otis approach two equally large males that were fighting?\" Mike's reply: \"It's not a common sighting, but in the video of the fight Otis wasn't the only bear to approach. The other bears near the far pool--503, 68--approached the fight as well. I don't have a good explanation for this behavior. Perhaps it was curiosity or they sensed one or both bears could be vulnerable to getting displaced if they approached. I'm not sure.\" Mike Fitz was asked: \"Thanks Mike what are your thoughts on Otis reaction to the fight near him?\" Mike's reply: \"I'm not sure why Otis approached, but I don't think it was to referee or otherwise intervene. 68 and 503 also moved close to the fight. Maybe they were curious and defensive at the same time?\" Cam viewer and park visitor, Cheri's Random Currents blog about the 474 and 32 Chunk fight, On March 9, 2018 Cheri also shared these September 2017 photos of 474: Photo #1 and Photo #2 Flyer 7474's 9/9/2017 video of 32 Chunk moving downstream after the fight with 474. 32 After the Encounter With 474 2017-09-09 Video by flyer 7474 Also on 9/9/2017, 32 Chunk is fishing in the jacuzzi when he is displaced by 747, video by Brenda D. 747 walks to and marks the island while 480 Otis observes him. 32 Chunk is now back in the jacuzzi and 747 has moved over near the far pool.

A 32 Chunk story: One evening in 2018, I was standing on the BF platform with a law enforcement ranger who was very familiar with the bears. A large bear came down the path by the nanny tree; and as this bear arrived at BF, a lot of younger, smaller bears dispersed. \"Is that 856?\" said the ranger, noting the way all the other bears took off. \"I *think* it's 32 Chunk,\" I said, \"with his perpetually worried look.\" The LE ranger looked at me in surprise -- and then he looked at 32's face. \"That's funny!\" he said. \"I never noticed before -- but he DOES look worried!\" It made me realize that watching the bears on the cams is sometimes very different than watching them in person. On the cams, we can see closeups of the bears' faces, and ears, and scars and stuff. . But if you're watching in person, you don't get that view. So here's to 32 Chunk, and his perpetually worried look! 2018.07.11: The Return of 32 Chunk video by Melissa Freels: The Return of 32 Chunk, July 11, 2018 by Melissa Freels 32 Chunk and 856 dominance display during play-by-play video by Lani H.: 856 and 32 Chunk dominance displays during PBP 7 11 2018 appx 7 45pm AK by Lani H 2018.07.19: 32 Chunk video by Brenda D.

Scooch shared this information about observing 32 Chunk and 68.: \"On that lovely autumn morning our attention was focused on Otis, the beloved idol of Brooks River, as he floated in the J, patiently waiting for scraps from 151 Walker, the lip fishing phenom, to wash over the falls. While engrossed in that view we heard someone mention that there was a huge bear at the far end of the island. We turned to see32 Chunkstanding there, in all his glory. He WAS huge, with rolls of fat on his chest and top of his legs, his front paws pointed inward under the strain of his weight. His thick coat was dry, revealing textured and curly fur that is not easily evident when viewed on the explore cams. He bent over to intently smell the area around a recently dug belly hole, then slowly walked to the other end of the island. He sat down and observed the activities of the few bears that were present before deciding to make his way across the river. To our surprise, he displaced 68 from the office, without even a grumble or hint of protest from 68. Even the expression on Chunk's face looked perplexed at how easy it was.\" Scooch also captured this photograph of 32 Chunk on September 16, 2019 (p 02/25/2020 01:22 ).: Please request Scooch'spermissionprior to using her photographs! 474 (closest) and 32 Chunk (farthest) can be seen peacefully fishing in the far pool in this 9/16/2019 video by Lani H. 474 and 32 Chunk in the far pool 9 16 2019, video by Lani H 2019.09.23:Mckate captured a video titled \"This is 32 Chunk\" on 9/23/2019. 23 Sep 2019 This is 32 Chunk, video by mckate 2019.09.26: 32 Chunk swats fish out of 503 Cubadult's mouth but loses it video by Lani H.: 32 Chunk swats fish out of 503's mouth but loses it 9 26 2019 by Lani H 2019.10.04: 32 Chunk and 503 Cubadult play fightingvideo (part 1) by Lani H.: 503 and 32 Chunk play fighting part 1 10 4 2019 by Lani H Mckate also captured video  of 32 and 503 playing on 10/4/2019. 4 Oct 2019 503 Plays 32 Out of the J, video by mckate 2019.10.05: 32 Chunk (left) and 503 (right) can be seen playing at Brooks Falls on 10/5/2019, video  by mckate.

Can anybody identify who this is?? I thought it was \"chunk\" but I am not sure.#2Actually, I think that the picture caused the huff.. When I saw him he was staring at me. So I slowly raised my camera. When the camera covered my face, he started huffing. I think that covering my face and hiding my eyes was not a good idea.#3This is something that I did not realize until I did it. If the bear is far away, its of no consequence. But if the bear is close, I would not hide my face/eyes with a camera.#4No. I was not on a platform at the time. There was not a platform in that area. When this occurred, I slowly, but purposefully headed to the closest one.#5I was told to stay at least 50 yards away..... But the bears would often come much closer. In the three days that I was there I had several come closer.#6I was alone at the time and it was very intimidating. Please request Mark Kostich's permission prior to using his photos!

Meet 128 Grazer - Bears of Brooks Falls, video by Explore Live Nature Cams 128 Grazer uses Brooks River in July and the fall, but like most females she typlically cannot compete with male bears for prime fishing spots. Recently, 128 has become one of the most skilled bears to fish the lip of Brooks Falls. In the fall, she will fish the lower river area, cut bank, and riffles. 128 is another bear who has learned to associate people with fish. This is a behavior shared with other bears like 438 Flo and 854 Divot. She is relatively habituated to people and will rapidly approach anglers who have a fish on the line. Anglers should give 128 extra space in the river and stop fishing well before she is within 50 yards. 128 Grazer is believed to be the 2005 offspring of 408 CC (Crooked Claw). 128 was part of a litter of three cubs that 408 kept for three summers from 2005 to 2007. In early July 2016 128 Grazer returned to Brooks River with three spring cubs, her 1st known litter. She was seen throughout the summer fishing the riffles, cut bank and falls. While fishing the falls, 128 initially avoided fishing the lip, instead opting to \"dash and grab\" around the area closest to the falls platform. Later in July, 128 began to occasionally fish the lip, but remained wary of other bears in proximity to her cubs. 128 proved to be remarkably protective of her first litter. She was seen chasing off and attacking several other females and dominant males who approached too closely, including 83 Wayne Brother, 402, 409 Beadnose, and 32 Chunk. Her aggressively protective approach appears to have paid off ~ 128 was last seen in fall of 2016 with all three of her spring cubs, looking healthy and well fed. 128 returned to the Brooks River on June 6, 2017 with all three offspring from her 1st litter, now yearlings. 128 Grazer is believed to be one of three 2005 offspring from 408 CC's (aka Crooked Claw) first known litter. 408 CC was very attentive to these 3 cubs and occasionally charged other bears that were simply walking by. 128 Grazer exhiitedthis same behavior with her first litter of cubs in 2016.408 CC kept this litter of cubs through their 3rd summer, emancipating them at age 3.5. 2005.??.??:  This 2005 iStock photo by jcrader is believed to be 408 CC and her 3 spring cubs. 128 Grazer is believed to be the spring cub in the middle.

She was seen throughout the summer fishing the riffles, cut bank and falls. While fishing the falls, 128 initially avoided fishing the lip, instead opting to \u201cdash and grab\u201d around the area closest to the falls platform. Later in July, 128 began to occasionally fish the lip, but remained wary of other bears in proximity to her cubs. 128 proved to be remarkably protective of her first litter. She was seen chasing off and attacking several other females and dominant males who approached too closely, including 83, 402, 409, and 32. Cam viewers affectionately referred to this 128 Grazer behavior as \"bear (insert bear number) got Grazered'. 408 CC, 128's mother, displayed the same hyperprotective behavior when raising 128 Grazer and her two littermates. 2016.??.??:In April of 2017, KNP&P Interpretive Ranger Kristen talkedabout 128 Grazer in a KNP&P video that sharessome 2016 footage of the 128 family group, including 128's interaction with 83 Wayne Brother (note: not 747).: Ranger Kristen talks 128 Grazer 2016.??.??: Xander-Sage shared these 2016 season snapshots (#1 , #2 , #3 , #4 & #5 )of 128 Grazer and her 3 spring cubs.

Grazer is determinedly digging along the bank while the cubbies spend six minutes playing. Almost all of it is Fifi playing with 903 while dark cub rests by mama. 903 is somewhere between 2 or 3 times the size of Fifi but it doesn't slow her down any.In case you're wondering what Grazer is digging for, you can faintly hear a Ranger talk about it, and it sounds like she was digging looking for small burrowing mammals.

Theresa commented \"One more group of pics promised on the book club meeting. Here is what \"Being Grazered\" looks like. It was pretty terrifying because it happened so fast and he just came unsuspectingly down the trail. He is so much larger than her and could have easily probably killed her or seriously injured her, at least. Afterwards she sat at the base of the tree her cubs were in still huffing & jaw-popping. It is pretty amazing to hear. She had a couple of puncture wounds on her face and a gash on her chest - 2 pics of little Peanut trying to make mom feel better a couple hours later when they took a nap right by the treehouse.

Her physique showed the lack of balance between the two needs. Even by mid July, 128 looked as thin as a lean spring bear. It is normal for sows with cubs to be skinnier than they are without cubs. Caring for cubs means less time fishing, and the calories gained by fish that are caught are \u201cshared\u201d among the family. Slowly but surely, Grazeradapted her behavior to compensate.Through the month of July, 128 Grazerhas demonstrated how balancing those conflicting needs is, like many things in the bear world, a learning process. 128\u2019s three spring cubs are her first litter. Soon after arriving to the Brooks River, she fiercely defended her cubs when 83 \u201cWayne Brother\u201d approached too close to the family group on his way to the falls. Just a few days later, 128 also charged 402, chasing her away from the river. Both of the bears 128 drove off are much larger than her. Throughout the middle of July, we watched 128 inch closer and closer to the falls. She became less stressed by the presence of other bears, allowing large males like 480 to approach within a dozen yards or closer. She spent less time looking over her shoulder and more time with her eyes trained on the schools of salmon in front of her. Towards the end of July, 128 even got up onto the lip, sometimes treeing her cubs while she fished. Still, Grazerremained vigilant.As are all bears, Grazerand her cubs were often at great risk by fishing at the falls. Late in July, 128 again needed to defend her cubs aggressively, this time against the largest bear on the river, 747. A few days later, her cubs were swept over the falls (August 6, 2016 video by Brenda D - unavailable as of 2021),sending Grazerinto a frenzied panic. In each brush with danger, 128 successfully protected her cubs.So far, Grazerseems to be winning in the \u201crisk vs. reward\u201d game of survival. As a result of her adapted behavior, \u201cGrazer\u201d has put on more weight. Her cubs have too. If and when we see \u201cGrazer\u201d again in the fall, there is no guarantee she will have all, or any, of her cubs with her. But whether she raises her cubs to be weaned or not, 128 is on her way to being a successful bear. As the season continues, we all hope to watch as she continues to balance the demands of her own survival against those of her cubs. In July 2016 park visitor, Jenny of Zealandia Designs, captured this video of 128 Grazer and her 3 spring cubs treeing themselves. Jenny also wrote a blog: Katmai Bears 2016, The Year of the Cubs where you can ready about her trip and see additional photos:: Brown Bears Do Climb Trees by Zealandia Designs 2016.07.??:   Laura Lyn Photography captured multiple July 2016 photos of 128 Grazer and her 3 spring cubs, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22 and #23.

When 128 is near the falls, her cubs often react to the movements of other bears by fleeing to the base of tree and frequently climb up it. 128 also seems to be quite defensive, more so than most other females with cubs at Brooks River. We\u2019ve witnessed her charging and sometimes attacking male bears who approach her too closely, including larger males like 83 and 747. We know that other bears pose a threat to her cubs, so why would a bear take her cubs to Brooks Falls? This is 128's first known litter. Motherhood is a new experience and challenge for her. It is not uncommon for bears with cubs to alter their behavior to give their cubs a greater chance of survival. 128, like 409 Beadnose, frequently fished on 2 of the 3 Spring Cubs of 128 Grazer Ranger Mike Fitz posted July 4, 2016 at 11:19  the lip of Brooks Falls last year when neither had any cubs. So far this year, we haven\u2019t seen either bear visit the lip. While 128 has made her way to the falls, 409 has completely avoided the area as far as I know. In contrast, 402 fishes at Brooks Falls regardless of her cubs\u2019 age. If you take your cubs to Brooks Falls, the reward in food can be exceptionally high, but the close proximity of other bears increases risk to cubs. If you avoid the falls in early July, then rich food sources like salmon are harder to find, but your cubs may face less threats from other bears. Each bear actively weighs risk versus reward when searching for food and raising offspring. This is especially conspicuous when we follow the stories of mother bears and the challenges they face.\" 2016.07.06: Park visitor and cam viewer, PhotobearsBry, captured a video of 128 Grazer and her 3 spring cubs.

This is well past my work day but as I was headed to the lodge around 7pm, there was 128 Grazer and her two cubs on the beach. I have a ton of photos of them, but here are a few of them as they passed by my cabin. They were very playful. I've been following them for the past couple of hours. They are still resting on the beach right now. But I couldn't wait to let you know because I realize that you will be as excited as I am. She (128 Grazer) was extraordinarily playful this evening. A little cautious, her first time in camp but played with her cubs a lot. One (cub) is clearly much smaller than the other. It is late and I can't get to sleep I am so excited about the experience with 128 this evening. It is incredible that one can't see her scar. It was so deep. The resiliency of bears always amazes me.

It was very difficult to see in real time. Explore Resident Naturalist Mike Fitz did a live chat to share his view of what had transpired between the subadult and 128 Grazer, video by Explore. Warning:Graphic and difficult to watch.  Mike Fitz went through the video explaining both the young bear and 128 Grazer's behavior. A summary of Mike's comments: \"The young bear was 2.5 maybe 3.5 years old, possibly recently emancipated and very hungry. It had earlier successfully reached up and stolen a fish from 128 Grazer. It was rewarded for the risk that it took. The subadult came back after consuming its fish off camera. It can be seen reaching up repeatedly. Grazer warned it several times by swatting at it. 128 Grazer's yearlings were stealing fish from mom. They were also very hungry. Grazer is stressed out and disciplines her own cub. The young subadult reaches up to attempt to grab fish. It gets close to Grazer's yearling.  For lack of a better word, 128 Grazer grabs the sub and is mauling it. During the violent interaction, other bears go about their business. Was the young bear injured? It probably felt pain but did not appear to have any apparent wounds. 128 Grazer appeared to grab it by the loose skin around its neck which probably prevented damage to tissue. The bear was in a vulnerable position but got a little bit lucky that Grazer wasn't able to grab any of the deep tissue. The young bear has been seen back at the falls. It hasn't approached 128 Grazer to try any of the same tactics. It is still quite bold maybe even fishing the lip of the waterfall.  This situation really did demonstrate the risk that young bears are willing to take to satisfy their hunger. It's a tough life being a young bear. You're separated from mom, you're at the bottom of the bear hierarchy. You've got to face a lot of competition in order to gain access to the salmon that will sustain you and help you gain the fat reserves necessary to survive winter hibernation.\" Grazer Attacks Small Bear - Bear Cam Break Down (Warning Graphic) Video by Explore Flyer 4477 also captured 7/19/2021 video of the event.

Outside my cabin in Valley Road housing, I saw a very light colored bear that looked like a subadult to me. Then came another bear, then another. It was Grazer and her two cubs coming from Lake Brooks, a place they frequent. They look terrific. Very exciting. The question: Will 128 emancipate her cubs in their 4th season?

However, like all bears his age, he is regularly displaced by more dominant bears at their preferred fishing locations. 2017 Bears of Brooks River book: 151 is a young adult male who will regularly visit Brooks Falls in July and fishes at the cut bank and lower Brooks River in the fall. As a young adult, 151 is sometimes displaced from his preferred fishing spots. However, he has grown significantly in recent years. During 2016 he was displaced less often and was seen displaying dominance over other, younger bears more often than in previous years. 151 is a particularly playful bear. He has been observed playing extensively with #503, #289, #32, and others. Bears hone survival skills by engaging in play. Play-fighting can improve the strength, speed, coordination, and muscle-memory needed during real fights for survival with other bears. 151 Walker was a spring cub with 818 (mother) and 152 littermate. 2008.07.25: Could this be 151 Walker as a yearling with 818 and 152 in this photo by Jim Chagares?

Young adults, like 151, are consistently challenged by older, larger, and more dominant bears. This is a fact of life in the bear world. The most dominant bears are the least likely to yield space or food while less dominant, younger bears are the most likely to yield. The hierarchy of bears at Brooks River changes every year, however. 151 may not be very dominant now, but neither was 747 or 856 (two of Brooks River\u2019s most dominant bears) at his age.

Both images were taken near the Riffles platform. In the 1st image, the male makes eye contact with me and gives me a huff from across the river. Later, he is mating with an unknown female. Any ideas who this muscular male is?? Thanks in advance for any help!! I am often asked, what is the biggest difference between watching the cams, and seeing the bears in person; besides the obvious answer of just being there. I would say that without a doubt, the biggest difference is that when you are there, the bear often watch you, and sometimes take an interest in what you are doing.\" Please request Mark Kostich's permission prior to using his photos!

Here are a couple of quick 151 stories. 1) 151 Walker was the first bear I saw in Brooks River. It was late June, so there weren't a lot of guests in the park -- and there weren't a lot of bears, either! I went out to the Riffles Platform around 8 a.m. I was the only one there -- and there was just one bear in the river. My first thought: \"That's a really big bear!\" My second thought -- based on the ringed eyes, the Mickey Mouse ears, and the location in the Riffles: \"That's 151 Walker!\" When I see 151 on the cams, I always think of him as a smaller bear -- because next to 480, or 747, or some of the other big males at the falls, he looks kind of junior. But when I saw him sitting there in the water -- the first bear I'd seen in the river -- he really has SUBSTANCE to him. 2) Early in July, on a very crowded day, I was working at the Falls platform. One of the bigger bears -- 856, maybe, or 747, had been courting 128 for a LONG time. She was NOT INTERESTED, and so she treed herself high up in a tall tree behind the BF platform. When she came down, she walked down to the Riffles, and soon after went into the woods w/151 Walker. He does have a way w/the ladies! 3) We saw 151 Walker in the river a lot. Once, I was talking w/a guest about 151, and I said, \"He's quite popular with the ladies.\" \"Do you mean with humans?\" she said. \"Or with bears?\" \"Both,\" I replied.... And those are my stories of 151 Walker, an amiable, omnipresent bear..\" 2018.06.??: Park visitor and cam viewer,Melissa Freels sharedthese June 2016 photos of 151 Walker and 708 Amelia:#1 708 Amelia following 151 Walker on Valley Road&#2 151 Walker following 708 Amelia on Valley Road.: Please request Melissa'spermissionprior to using her photos! 2018.06.??:Lesleezee sharedthisphotoof 708 Amelia and 151 Walker by the walkway near the tree house in June 2018 at Brooks falls. 151 came up to the falls with 719 and left with 708!

I had watched 409 so much earlier this summer that I started to see her everywhere. I looked at your photographs from this morning, and mine, and y\u2019all were right, that was 708 with 151 this morning.\" Ranger Russ also shared these 4 photographs of 151 Walker and 708 Amelia from this morning. Photo #1 , #2 , #3 , & #4 .: Volunteer-in-park, Stacey shared her 151 Walker & 708 Amelia story (p 02/09/2020 05:37 ).: \"Here is a 708 Amelia story (kind of): It was late June 2018, my second day (I think) volunteering at Brooks Camp. I was receiving an informal orientation before my actual volunteer service began, and I was with a group of people, including a ranger, standing at the Corner, on the Brooks Lodge side of the bridge. KNPP had the floating bridge at that time, and the bridge was closed, because the two bears above -- 151 Walker and 708 Amelia -- were canoodling near the LR platform. Viewers on the LR platform were transfixed -- we could see lots of cameras pointed at the two lovebirds. But we couldn't see the encounter itself. On our side of the bridge, we waited patiently for the bear jam to end, and gazed across the river, trying to catch a glimpse of the two adorable canoodlers. Suddenly, just a few feet behind me, I heard a loud \"huff.\" And at the same time, the ranger's radio crackled, \"Corner!\" The ranger on the LR platform was radio-ing because they'd spotted a bear at the Corner -- just as the bear arrived and huffed loudly to announce its presence. I looked over my shoulder, and there the bear was -- maybe 3-5 feet away from me and the human group. This was my first real encounter with a bear, and the ranger we were with was excellent. \"Okay,\" he said calmly, \"I want you all to move behind me.\" We shuffled smoothly and quickly away from the bear and behind the ranger. \"And now we're going to move away from the bear,\" he said, and moved us 50 yards down the campground trail, away from Corner, and toward the lodge. The bear followed, about 25 yards behind the group. \"So now we're going to step off the trail,\" the ranger said, calmly reminding us of the instructions we'd learned in bear orientation. We moved off the trail, and the bear walked past. \"I know you all think this is a good time for cell phone pictures,\" the ranger said, \"but it's really not.\" The visitors smiled sheepishly and pocketed their phones. I've always wondered who the bear was! Was it 708 Amelia, who may have swum across the river after her romantic encounter w/151 Walker? Or was it another bear, who either swam across the river or who came up through the trees between Corner and the Point? I'll likely never know. But I've always been so impressed w/the ranger's calm, by-the-book handling of the situation, which I've tried to use as a model ever since. And that's my story of 708 Amelia -- or really, the story of what was happening on the other side of the bridge at the same time that 708 and 151 were canoodling at LR.\" 2018.07.??: Park visitor, Mike Weagley captured this July 2018videothat includes:171 sitting on the log at 0:41, 151 Walker at 0:55, 854 Divot at 1:02, and 504 at2:02.

This 9/5/2020 video by Cam Op Aspire (kwaahu) is quite interesting. 151 Walker gets a little rough with play. CamOp Aspire commented \"151 Walker had gotten many lessons in discipline from 128 Grazer, and 747 this season.  He'd tried asserting himself over some subadults who were minding their own business, which wound up getting him into a bit of trouble.  Here, 812, a younger Bear who still has the gift of play and that openness that the young possess, entices 151 to play with him.  After the first entreaties, to which Walker was receptive, he bursts into an aggressive move and grabs 812's cheek in his jaws.  He holds on for quite a long time, leaning in close to 812's ear.  I could almost hear him say, \"listen carefully:  I am playing with you now, but I want to be VERY CLEAR that this does not mean we are equals.  Don't challenge me or my authority.\"  During this time, 812 was totally still, not pulling away, not fighting back.  He listened carefully.  After 151 let him go, 812 submissively, almost childlike, was trying to engage him in more play, which he did, to some extent. It's a touching and sad display of how the playfulness is leaving 151.   Perhaps he has lost his innocence as well as he's grown older, getting caught up in \"grown up\" things.  Let's hope that 812 holds onto his for as long as possible.\" The play's the thing, but 151 needed to assert himself, too 05 09 20 Video by CamOp Aspire (kwaahu) 2020.09.06:  Mckate's 9/6/2020 video of 151 Walker launching a sneak attack on 820. \"Some day he is going to regret having picked on these large young bears.\" 6 Sep 2020- 151 Launches Sneak Attack on 820 Video by mckate 2020.09.07:  151 Walker and 820 play, 9/7/2020 video by Lani H. 151 Walker and 820 play 9-7-2020 Video by Lani H 2020.09.08:  Lani H 9/8/2020 video of 151 Walker sitting above the falls. 151 Walker sitting above the falls 9-8-2020 Video by Lani H 2020.09.09:  747 moves 151 Walker and 820 out of the office, 856 breaks up 747 having words with 820, 9/9/2020 video by Lani H. 747 moves 151 Walker and 820 out of the office, 856 breaks up 747 having words with 820 9-9-2020 Video by Lani H 2020.09.10: Cam viewer and park visitor 907AKSnow capturedvideoof 719 and 151 Walker on 9/10/2020. 719 confronts 151 Walker to warn him to not approach her cubs who are behind her at the island. 719-Princess has a few words with 151-Walker.

I head that way, staying safely behind Ranger Nick. And there they were. They had already mated, but the large male was standing, rubbing against a tree, leaving his mark. The female then left, coming towards us and moving down Park Avenue, where our cabins are. Ranger Nick and I then backed away because we knew that the male would soon follow his infatuation. He followed her, passing us within a few yards and coming within feet of Ranger Rylee standing in front of her cabin. Just another day in Brooks Camp. Now, you tell me who this amorous boar is. (we know, but aren't telling).\" Ranger Naomi shared 2 photos of the amorous boar, #1 and #2. Ranger Naomi later commented \"Well, it looks like we have a lot of very smart bear cam lovers here.

Did you notice how the smaller yearling in that litter behaves differently than it\u2019s larger siblings? The larger yearlings seem to more actively pursue their mother and take fish from her. She will nurse them, but mother bears won\u2019t bring food to their cubs. The cubs have to compete with one another for access to other food sources, like the fish that 409 catches. In most instances, it seems like the larger cubs (one of which is probably a male) are willing to pursue mom to get fish while the smaller cub won\u2019t. This is an example of how bears are individuals, even at a young age. As they grow, differences in disposition may even become more obvious.\" 2013.08.31: Juergen created these gifs (#1 & #2 ) of 409 Beadnose's three yearlings near the lower river wildlife viewing platform.: 2013.09.05: KNP&P's September 5, 2013 16:37 Facebook post: \"409 and her yearlings are back!

I'm not sure what it might be other than scars and swellings caused by biting insects. A bear's eyelids seem to be quite vulnerable to insect bites. I once watched 409 and 634 copulating near the falls platform and through my binoculars I could see their eyes swarmed by black flies while they were preoccupied. Sometimes the skin on moose can be eaten nearly raw by flies in summer as explained in this article.I've never seen anything like that on bears though. Perhaps bears are just better at keeping flies off. No matter what, they must have a very high tolerance for biting insects.\" Please request Truman Evert's permission prior to using his photos! 2017.09.11:409 Beadnose and her yearlings (909 & 910) relax on the banks of the Lower Brooks River video by Flyer 7474 (aka SteveCA).: 409 on the Lower Brooks River 2017 09 11 by Flyer 7474 (aka SteveCA) 2017.09.14:  409 Beadnose and her 2 yearling cubs (909 and 910)  charge a running bear, 9/4/2017 video by Birgitt. 409, 909 & 910 Charge a Running Bear 2017-09-14 15-09-28(explore.org) Video by Birgitt 2017.09.16: NPS photo of 409 Beadnose from round 2 of the 2017 Fat Bear Week contest.: 2017.10.04: 409 Beadnose goes up against her niece, 128 Grazer in round 2 of the 2017 Fat Bear Week contest.: KNP&P's October 4, 2017 12:00 Facebook post .: \"Round 2 features warrior vs. the wise with two more beefy mother bears. 409 Beadnose is raising her 4th litter this year, outperforming 128 Grazer 4 to 1 in the reproduction department.

I took this back in 2018. No one knew that this would be her last season at the falls. (I do not know who is next to her). Second image (2nd image is on 909's Bear Book Page): When I returned to Brooks Falls this past August, I witnessed a sub-adult fishing the same spot that Beadnose used. The sub-adult was aggressively defending its spot at the point against a bigger bear. It was a very spunky and very vocal bear. When I asked Ranger Sheryl who the small bear was, Sheryl responded, \"thats 909, Beadnose's daughter.\" It was so very cool to see her fish the same point as her mother.

Online fans voted bear 409 \u201cFattest Bear\u201d in the culmination of Fat Bear Week, a March-Madness style competition on the national park\u2019s social media. In a final vote on October 9th, 409 Beadnose was crowned champion for the 2ndtime in the event\u2019s five-year history. She bested another astoundingly large bear, 747, a boar whose belly barely makes clearance with the ground. A total thirteen bears from the Brooks River area of Katmai National Park were listed in the competition when it began on October 3rd. Though she was flying solo this year, bear 409 has raised four litters of cubs since being first identified as a subadult bear in 1999. After emancipating two cubs in early this year, she was able to keep all of that savory salmon to herself\u2026 allowing her to balloon into the bulging bear that captivated audiences online. This weight gain is a necessity for bears, as it helps them to survive a long winter of hibernation. Over the course of winter hibernation, a bear could lose up to one third of its body mass. In a few short months, they will have to gain it all back. This transformative weight gain was on full display during Fat Bear Week with \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d comparison photos.

This is the first season that 409 has not been observed at Brooks River since initially being classified as a subadult in 1999. 2020.01.12: January 12, 2020 was 409 Beadnose's bear celebration day on the Bearcam comments. Fencepost shared this confession about 409 Beadnose being the bear that got Fencepost addicted to Bearcam.: \"Can't find any of my own (dang!) pics or vids of Beadnose but I wanted to say how much she means to me.I have said this many times but it truly was dear Bearnose who got me hooked here. I found the cams in 2015 and watched a few minutes here, a few there. I still wasn't completely aware of what I was witnessing. Then I saw Beadnose stroll out on the falls. Her mastery of the lip, her smooth style and seemingly effortless catches blew me away. That was it, I couldn't stay away. I was so absorbed with watching the bears it took until the summer of 2016 before I found the chat! D'oh!! Thank You all for taking the pics, making the vids and digging up ones made by others. I know weAllhope our darling Beadnose strolls out onto the lip one more time.\" (p 01/12/2020 07:38 ) February 2023:  Deanna Dittloff (aka deelynnd) created this tribute video \"Beadnose and Her Legacy.\" It includes photos and videos from 2002-2022.

Now however, we know she has emancipated her cubs and is once again single. 856, perhaps more than anyone, knows this as well, and his proximity to Beadnose reveals his amorous intentions.\" 409 Beadnose was observed being courted by 856 on the morning of June 16, 2018 per Ranger Russ' June 16, 2018 10:35 comment: \"Good morning from Alaska. I'll be here the next half hour should you have any questions. Yes, we do expect to have the bearcams to be running and the Bear Book out by next week. There were no bear sightings yesterday. This morning 856 was seen pursuing 409.

Explore Live Nature Cams video: Bear 51 Diver Jr Courts 409 Beadnose June 2018 by Explore Live Nature Cams-0 In 2004, 409 Beadnose returned to the Brooks River with her 1st known litter of 1 spring cub. This cub was the original \"Velcro\". This yearling is described in NPS bear ID database as \"very large\" and engaged in long play bouts with 409. 409 and her yearling are seen in thisJune 25, 2005 photo by Don Abernathyand thisJuly 14, 2005 photo by Mullen Photography. In 2007, 409 Beadnose returned to the Brooks River with her 2nd known litter of 3 spring cubs, but soon lost one. One of the cubs was a female that was later independently identified as 130 Tundra. Another cub from this litter was known as \"Arctic\". \"Arctic\" was never independently identified as a subadult. 409 Beadnose raised 130 Tundra and \"Arctic\" through 2008. 130 Tundra (female) and \"Arctic\" were successfully emancipated by 409 Beadnose in 2009. Brooks Lodge's June 30, 2013 12:53 Facebook post with Kara Stenberg's photograph: \"Arctic\" on the hunt for Sockeyes this weekend - another great photo from Kara Stenberg: Mike Fitz, former Katmai National Park & Preserve ranger, has shared with us that \"Arctic\" was not documented as an independent subadult by park staff norassigned a bear monitoring number. Mike;s February 6, 2016 comment was: \"We never ID'd that bear (\"Arctic\") after it was weaned, or if it did return we weren't able to recognize it as 409's offspring.\" One thing to note in the comments on the June 30, 2013 Brooks Lodge Facebook post is that Tammy Carmack also participated in that comment thread and did not comment about \"Arctic\" in Kara Stenberg's photograph not being \"Arctic\", a female, or 409 Beadnose's offspring. Tammy Carmack may have been in agreement with the information Brooks Lodge posted with the photograph by Kara Stenberg. In 2012, 409 Beadnose returnd to the Brooks River with her 3rd known litter, 2 females & 1 male spring cub. The largest and smallest were females. The middle-sized cub was a male. In 2013, 409 Beadnose and her 3 yearlings remained as a family group. The largest and smallest were females. The middle-sized yearling was a male. In 2014, it is believed that 409 Beadnose successfully emancipated her 3 2.5 year-old offspring. 500 Indy is believed to be the largest of 409's offspring from this litter. There is speculation that 717 is the female runt from 409 Beadnose's 2012 litter. In 2016, 409 Beadnose returned to the Brooks River with her 4th known litter, 2 female spring cubs. 909 is believed to be the blonder female offspring and 910 is believed to be the darker female offspring from this 2016 litter. In 2017, 409 Beadnose and her 2 female yearlings remained as a family group.909 is believed to be the blonder female offspring and 910 is believed to be the darker female offspring from this 2016 litter. In 2018, 409 Beadnose returned to the Brooks River with her 2 female 2.5 year-old cubs on or before May 22, 2018. These two offspring were successfully emancipated during the 2018 season, initially observed and classified as independent subadults. 909 is believed to be the blonder of these two offspring. 910 is believed to be the darker of these two offspring. 408/409 family tree - updated Nov 2022 Littermate:408 CC (Crooked Claw) Offspring: 2004 Litter:1 spring cub, \"Velcro\" (The original \"Velcro\") 2007 Litter:130 Tundra & Arctic (individual identification number not known), Speculated 2012 Litter:500 Indy & 717 (?), Speculated 2016Litter:909 & 910, Speculated 409 Beadnose was successfully darted by Ranger Michael Saxton for the genetics study in 2016. 409 Beadnose is darted for the Genetics Study 2016 KNP&P video-0 That pink dart retrieves a DNA sample, without ever having to sedate the bear.

In the summer, she often appears to have a medium brown to gray coat as she sheds her winter fur. However, her ears are blonde tipped. With brown claws, she often transforms into a medium to dark brown bear by fall. Her ears, however, remain with their blonde tips, which is an easy identifier for this ear. 409 also has an upturned nose which appears to be \"beaded\" at the tip and lends itself to her nickname of \"Beadnose\" Life History: 409 was first identified as a subadult in 2009 and is widely believed to be a sibling of female Bear #408. Often times, especially in the fall, 409 and 408 would often be confused with one another. When not caring for cubs, 409 tends to be one of the fattest bears during the fall along the Brooks River. During the summer months, 409 becomes the poster bear for the iconic shot of a bear catching a fish in its mouth on the lip of Brooks Falls. 409 is a master lip fisher and can be seen standing atop the falls with her signature move of lifting her right front paw up while she's awaiting the jumping salmon. When the salmon jump, she uses her powerful jaw to snatch the fish, but also her right front paw to help hold the fish in her mouth. It almost seems as though 409 can get \"frustrated\" or \"impatient\" at times when unsuccessfully fishing the lip as she will use that raised right front paw to \"slap\" at the water. During the fall months, and when she is caring for cubs, she is often seen down in the Lower River near the mouth of Brooks River where it flows into Naknek Lake, or walking along the Spit. 409 has had 4 known litters of cubs (2004, 2007, 2012 and 2016) that have produced a known total of 9 cubs. She is believed to be the mother of Bear #130 Tundra (2007 litter) and Bear #500 Indy (2012 litter). In 2015, 409 won the Fat Bear Tuesday contest judged by bear cam viewers to be the fattest bear of the season."}, {"name": "435 Holly", "bio": "435 Holly July 2021 NPS photo Adult Female Year First Identified: 2001 as a young adult or older subadult (2010 book) /2001 as a young adult (2014 book) Year Last Observed: 2023 Offspring Of: Unknown Known Litters of Cubs: 5as of 2020season Genetics Study Samples Obtained: 2016 and 2017 darting attempt by Ranger Michael Saxton for the genetics study were successful. 2010 Bears of Brooks River book:435 Holly has a medium-small body with a distinctivelight blonde coat.Her ears are large and lighter than her coat.

Bears are generally selfish creatures who are not known for displays of altruism, so why would 435 Holly adopt the yearling?Some biologists hypothesize that altruism evolved in some animals is a result of shared genes. If costs to your own fitness are not too great, it would make sense for you to care for your siblings and their offspring because you share genes with them, genes that will be passed on when they reproduce. However, 402, the abandoned yearling\u2019s mother, and 435 Holly are not known to be related.

From what I was able to observe, it appears that Hollly's adopted yearling decided to assert itself over 500. The yearling initiated the interaction several minutes prior when he approached 500. This was more likely a playful approach from the yearling, but 500 wanted no part of it, perhaps because the yearling was being trailed by Holly. When the interaction began, Holly was very close to the yearling. 500 didn't want to be close to the family. When she ran, the yearling pursued and that's what the cam caught. Holly was just trying to keep up with her cubs! Subadult bears, like 500, hold the lowest position in the bear hierarchy. They are easily displaced by other bears, as this interaction demonstrates. If you are a cub, you often hold a higher position in the hierarchy than subadults because of your mother's close proximity. Times have certainly changed for the adopted yearling. Shortly after it was abandoned in July, he ran from everything. Now, he looks confidenet, well fed, and able to test some boundaries. For bear 500, she's going through a stage that all bears must endure to reach adulthood. Holly's adopted yearling may be asserting itself now, but once it is driven away by Holly, it will experience everything that 500 is enduring now.\" You can read more about the interaction in the 10/07/2014 KNP&P Terrane blog by Ranger Mike Fitz: Chasing Bigger Bears . 435 Holly's adopted yearling chases subadult bear 500 October 5, 2014 KNP&P video-1 2014.10.13: 435 Holly's biological female spring cub (now 719) is the focus of this video by JoeBear. 435 Holly can be seen urinating at the 7:50 mark.: Holly's Little Girl (719) 10.13.2014 video by JoeBear-0 2014.10.16: 435 Holly with her biological female spring cub (719) and her adopted male yearling (503 Cubadult) video by Linda Jett: 2014 10 16 0848 24 Drama Holly Attacks Chocolate Beauty by Linda Jett 435 Holly was included in the 2015 Bears of Brooks River book on page 40.: In 2015, the mixed family returned to Brooks River andwere seen together in October of that year.

At 20:58 Ranger Dave  shares a photo of 503 Cubadult by Ranger Anela: Ranger Tammy Carmack, KNP&P Bear Technician talks about the return of 435 Holly's blended family group in this KNP&P video posted on the KNP&P facebook pageon 05/23/2017. 435 Holly and the cubs can be seen in the video on the day they returned to Brooks Camp (05/21/2016). 2016.05.23: Mike Fitz, former KNP&P Ranger and Visual Information Specialist shares his thoughts about 435 Holly and both cubs returning to the river together in his Explore blog:Another Summer with Holly and Her Cubs: \"Last week, Brooks River\u2019s most famous bear family\u2014435 Holly, her biological (now 2.5 year-old) female cub, and her adopted (now 3.5 year-old) male cub\u2014were seen for a brief time at Brooks River. Last fall, the future of this family was a target for much speculation. Would 435 keep her cubs for another year? Or, is it time for them to go their separate ways? It may be too early to answer those questions definitively. Katmai\u2019s mother bears usually keep their cubs for two to three summers before separating from them. The cubs\u2019 emancipation happens in spring after the bears emerge from their dens and is not voluntary. Hormonal changes, likely related to the return of the mother bear\u2019s estrus cycle, cause her to become increasingly intolerant of her offspring. While I\u2019ve never seen this separation occur, it\u2019s been described as somewhat sudden and aggressive. The cubs may not know what\u2019s coming. \u201cIt must be a traumatic experience for the juvenile bears to be evicted by a mother who has fed and protected them all their lives,\u201d mused Will Troyer, one of the first biologists to study Katmai\u2019s bears. This is an event every bear must endure as it matures. But, late May is here and Holly still has her cubs. Does this mean the cubs will be spared from separation until next spring? Some evidence suggests they still may go their separate ways. In early May 2008, 408 CC returned to Brooks River with her three 3.5 year-old offspring. We watched them play near Brooks Lodge before they disappeared into the forest. When 408 came back that July, she was single. She drove away her cubs sometime between those two events. Bears at Brooks River usually don\u2019t vary in the amount of time they keep their offspring. If they wean them at 2.5 years, for example, then they are likely to wean subsequent litters at that age as well. 435 Holly weaned her only known surviving offspring, 89 Backpack, when he was a 2.5 year-old. We know that bears separate from their offspring at this time of the year, and Holly\u2019s biological cub from her current litter is 2.5 years old, the same age as 89 Backpack when he was weaned. However, it would be a mistake to use these anecdotes as absolute predictors for this bear family in 2016. So much of this family\u2019s history is atypical. The stress of separation might be great for newly weaned cubs, but a mother doesn\u2019t do it out of malice. Nor does she \u201cchoose\u201d to keep her cubs to be nice. The mother\u2019s biology will dictate the family\u2019s separation or continued unity.\" 2016.06.20: 435 Holly video by Ratna: Awesome Holly June 20, 2016 by Ratna 2016.06.29: 435 Holly and 856 splash and dash down the riffles video by Arlene Beech: Holly and 856 go bouncing!

I'm not sure what it might be other than scars and swellings caused by biting insects. A bear's eyelids seem to be quite vulnerable to insect bites. I once watched 409 and 634 copulating near the falls platform and through my binoculars I could see their eyes swarmed by black flies while they were preoccupied. Sometimes the skin on moose can be eaten nearly raw by flies in summer asexplained in this article.I've never seen anything like that on bears though. Perhaps bears are just better at keeping flies off.

Here are 3 Holly stories from my time volunteering at Brooks Camp last summer: 1) Holly and her two cubs were EVERYWHERE! I think I saw them more than anyone else (human or ursine). They liked to sleep on the beach in the afternoon -- greeting the planes.:-) At least one of her cubbies liked to climb on the gravel pile. And they would frequently cause bear jams near the bridge. 435 Holly seemed quite comfortable at Brooks Camp! They may have been the most visible bears in camp during July! 2) When I was there, I'd get up early (around 4:20 a.m.) and walk down to the beach. One morning, on my way to the beach, I looked down toward the Visitors Center (about 100 yards away). There, standing at the bottom of the steps, were 435 Holly and her two cubs! They were looking up the stairs toward the door of the empty building. I laughed out loud, and in my mind, I heard 435 saying, \"Here, my dear cubs, is where the humans go to learn how to behave around bears!\" 3) At Brooks Camp, you're allowed to eat a) outdoors behind an electric fence or b) in hard-sided buildings (like cabins, or at the Lodge). Many days, during my lunch break after working at the Falls platform, I would sit in the lunch building (usually alone), and I would OFTEN hear bears pulling up grass on the sides of the building. I'd look out the window, but I never saw anyone -- but I knew they were there! One day, late in July, I exited the building (singing, as always, to let the bears know I was coming) and I saw TWO BEARS, about 30 yards away. One of the bears was jumping on the back of the other and I immediately thought, \"Gosh, it's awfully late in the season for mating, isn't it?!\" And then I realized that the two bears were 435 Holly's yearlings, playing. Those. Yearlings. Were. HUGE! From where I stood, they seemed almost as big as me! I'd thought they were subadults. And they were on the path between me and the place I needed to go. Knowing that 435 was nearby, I resisted the urge to stand and watch them play (since I was closer than the 50-yard limit). So I went back inside the building and tried to watch through the window. Not the same! So grateful to have had so much sightings of the illustrious 435 and her beautiful yearlings. 435 has such a distinguished lineage (89 Backpack, 719, 503 Cubadult) -- and I can't wait to see who these yearlings become.\" Park visitor Mark Forsyth captured video of 435 Holly and her 2 yearlings in 2018.

We were stopped just beyond the gift shop by a ranger because there was a sub on the beach who could not make up its mind as to where it wanted to go. so we were talking, standing there waiting, we got the all clear signal and were just going to move and I glanced to the right and there she was Ms Holly and her chubby fat cubs sitting there quietly watching us. it was surreal, we were too close.

During a windy late Sep evening at the Lower River, her famous appetite, takes her away from her two yearlings at the bank.When a subadult shows up and her cubs bolt, she realizes how far away she is in the river and hauls her prodigious behind, to make up the distance and fully charge the sub. She turns on the afterburners in full mamma bear mode. Through rough approximations we get to run the numbers on 435's swimming and closing speed.

We were constantly on the lookout for her, hoping to get an eyeful of the curvaceous icon of Brooks River. By our third day there I had all but given up hope of seeing her. That afternoon, as we started across the bridge on our way to the falls, we stopped in our tracks and did a double take towards the spit. There she was! Her coat of many colors nearly camouflaged her among her surroundings but her hippo sized buxom behind was unmistakable! She appeared to be searching for something and we soon discovered what it was - the perfect spot to dig a belly hole. She dug and dug until she had excavated a nice, cozy trench into which she slowly settled her ample paunch. Just as she was getting comfortable, her daughter719 came strolling by with her coys, Holly's grandsons, trailing behind. She and 719 exchanged quick glances before 719 continued on her way. The adorable cubs actually sat down and stared at their grandmother. They were probably amazed at the size of her! The cubs then joined their mother in the lake while Grandma Holly drifted off, to dream of juicy salmon and fat bear titles. What a joy it was to see three generations of that family in such close proximity to each other.\" Please request Scooch'spermissionprior to using her photographs!

Meet480 Otis video by Mike Fitz: Meet 480 Otis - Bears of Brooks Falls by Mike Fitz, Resident Naturalist with Explore.org 2010 Bears of Brooks River book & 2012 Brown Bears of Brooks Camp iBook:480, along with 218, uses some of the most efficient fishing techniques at the falls. He prefers the jacuzzi, but unlike many other bears, he is often tolerant of numerous other bears around him while he eats. These bears wait patiently for him to finish and eat any leftover scraps. In September, he is one of the few bears that can successfully fish at Brooks Falls. Late in the season, he is often seen fishing the far pool. 2012 Brown Bears of Brooks Camp iBook: Additional information provided in the 2012 edition: Despite the fact that 480 is neither as large nor aggressive as other male bears, during July 2011 he was rarely displaced from his preferred fishing spot in the jacuzzi. Even 856, arguably the most aggressive bear in 2011, rarely attempted to challenge 480 for this prime location. In September, 856 and other bears seemed less tolerant of him and / or more willing to challenge him over positions at Brooks Falls. This pattern continued in July 2012, and larger bears regularly displaced him from the jacuzzi. 2014 Bears of Brooks River book:480 was first classified as an older subadult bear in 2001. He, along with #218, uses some of the most efficient fishing techniques at the falls. He prefers the jacuzzi, but unlike many other bears, he is often tolerant of numerous otherbears around him while he eats. These bears wait patiently for him to finish and eat any leftover scraps.

Despite the fact that #480 is neither as large nor aggressive as other male bears, he was rarely displaced from his preferred fishing spot in the jacuzzi. However in recent years, other mature males have surpassed him in size. As a result,480 has slipped down the bear hierarchy. Bears like 747 and 856 will now regularly displace him from his preferred fishing spots. 2015 - 2016 Bears of Brooks River books:He, along with 218, uses some of the most efficient fishing techniques at the falls. He prefers the jacuzzi, but unlike many other bears, he is often tolerant of numerous other bears around him while he eats. These bears wait patiently for him to finish and eat any leftover scraps. Despite the fact that 480 is neither as large nor aggressive as other male bears, he was rarely displaced from his preferred fishing spot in the jacuzzi from 2005-2011. However in recent years, other mature males have surpassed him in size. As a result, 480 has slipped down the bear hierarchy. Bears like 747 and 856 will now regularly displace him from his preferred fishing spots and 814 will steal fish from him. He is one of the few bears that can successfully fish at Brooks Falls in September. Late in the season, he is often seen fishing in the far pool. 480 may be one of the older bears along the river, but he was once a more playful bear. In 2003, for instance, he was observed playing with many bears including 489 and 634. 2017 Bears of Brooks River book: Additional information provided in the 2017 edition of the book: In 2016, 480 returned to Brooks River missing two canine teeth. The injury somewhat inhibited his ability to \u201chigh-grade\u201d\u2013to pick out the fattiest parts of the salmon (skin, brain, and roe)\u2013but did not stop him from putting on the necessary weight for winter survival. An experienced brown bear, missing teeth are just one more obstacle 480 has overcome to survive another year. 2018 Bears of Brooks River book:480 Otis is missing two canine teeth. The injury appears to inhibit his ability to \u201chigh-grade\u201d\u2013to pick out the fattiest parts of the salmon (skin, brain, and roe)\u2013but did not stop him from putting on the necessary weight for winter survival. An experienced brown bear, missing teeth are just one more obstacle 480 has overcome to survive year after year. 480 Otis is believed to be the oldest male bear (boar) to regularly using the falls, he faces many challenges one of which is missing teeth. He is missing two canine teeth one on the upper jaw and one on the lower jaw on the opposite side. When you watch him eat fish you can see he does so with a little more difficulty than other bears. 480 Otis is currently not known to have any offspring that use the river, In 2006-7 a DNA study was done by collecting hair and tissue samples and no known offspring of Otis were found. A new DNA study is underway at Brooks River and we may find out if he in fact does have offspring that use the river. 480 Otis has won the Fat Bear contest three years 2014, 2016 , and2017, 480 Otis was initially identified as an older subadult or young adult.

JBirdyHome shared these thoughts with the video.: \"An usual activity for Otis who is usually spotted sitting in \"the office\" (the far end of the falls, under the hanging foliage) gazing patiently at the water for hours. But here he is meandering through the water. Perhaps the water level and force of the falls is too high and rough to fish and he chooses to inspect calmer waters.\" Katmai Park Brooks Falls Otis - 480 Fishes Brooks Falls 10 9 15 by JBirdyHome 480 Otis was included in the 2016 Bears of Brooks River book on page 72.: In 2016, 480 returned to Brooks River missing two canine teeth. The injury somewhat inhibited his ability to \u201chigh-grade\u201d\u2013to pick out the fattiest parts of the salmon (skin, brain, and roe)\u2013but did not stop him from putting on the necessary weight for winter survival. An experienced brown bear, missing teeth are just one more obstacle 480 has overcome to survive another year. 2016.??.??: Cam viewer's 2016 season snapshot of 480 Otis. #1 Lani H previously added to 480's wiki page on October 27, 2016 . #2 480 Otis swats a salmon ~ BBWonderdogs previously added to 480's wiki page on October 27, 2016 . #3 BBWonderdogs previously added to 480's wiki page on October 27, 2016 .

The other bears near the far pool--503, 68--approached the fight as well. I don't have a good explanation for this behavior.

Stacey shared her story in this April 9, 2019 05:14 comment: \"Hi, everyone! A few days ago, @mazeyposted a wonderful video by @Martina of the 2018 return of Sir Uncle King 480 O T I S! (Link to video at bottom of post.) Here's a related story It was Friday, June 29, 2018, my third day volunteering at Brooks Camp. I was working in the Visitors Center, presenting a Junior Ranger badge to a visitor named Esme. It was Esme's 10th birthday -- and for her gift, she had chosen to bring her entire family to Brooks Camp to see the bears. And on her birthday, she was receiving her Junior Ranger Badge. So we're in the Visitors Center, and I'm presenting her with the badge as her family watches, and she's holding up her hand as I lead her through the Junior Ranger oath. And it's a very solemn and joyful and auspicious moment. And/but as I'm leading Esme through the oath, I'm also watching the BF cam on the TV in the Visitors Center -- and I'm seeing a large, blond bear on the island! And as I'm leading Esme through the oath, I'm thinking, \"Wait. Is that 480 O T I S?! What's he doing back? It's only the end of June!\" And that bear, 480 O T I S, *dove* into the jacuzzi, just as Esme completed her pledge! And I started to cry (which the other rangers never let me forget), because Esme became a Junior Ranger just as 480 O T I S dove into the jacuzzi, and on her 10th birthday to boot! And so, in addition, to her Junior Ranger badge, I also awarded Esme one of my very precious Bear Booster pins, for guests who went above and beyond in supporting the bears. Because Junior Ranger Esme brought her family to Brooks Camp for her 10th birthday. And 480 O T I S showed up to celebrate, too. And that is my story of 480 O T I S. And here's the great video by @Martina.

First Impressions are Everything...We went to Brooks in early July 2019 and didn't know a single bear. We were thrilled to see six bears at the Falls that afternoon. We watched a couple of bears catch and eat fish from the J. Then this very blonde bear came down the hill and started strolling towards the falls. We couldn't help but notice his very blonde poofy ears and coat coloring. #2. He checked in at the Office, but decided that wasn't the best spot, so he kindly asked a young lad to step aside. #3. He settled into his spot where all could admire his handsome physique, basking in the sunlight. #4. This bear stood out amongst the others. #5. As we left the falls, we caught another view of him, not knowing how that side would later become the talk of the town.

As I approached the Brooks Falls platform for the very first time in July 2019, I saw Otis in the jacuzzi and said/squeed two things: \"It's Otis!\" and \"He's huge!\" In hindsight, that last sounds ridiculously obvious for a bearcam fan.

The water taxi was leaving a little early because the water was rough so when we left, I was just a little disappointed that I wasn't able to see Otis. We had already left the beach when we got word we had to turn around to pick up another passenger. They told us we could have about another 30 minutes or so at Brooks. So I went back out to the bridge and there were no bears to be seen. I heard crashing in the bushes below and knew there was a bear coming through. It was Otis! He provided me an Otis-sized cherry on top of what was already a fabulous trip. I will certainly never forget it!

The earth shook, not when he moved his massive girth through the river, but when his fans around the world applauded upon seeing the old man. We often speak of the qualities that help bears survive the very challenging lives they lead and Otis is the embodiment of those qualities. At age 25 or 26, he is the river\u2019s oldest boar, yet he remains one of its most successful. Despite missing several teeth and moving a little more slowly, Otis continues to be one of the fattest bears here. His patience and tenacity are two qualities that enable him to thrive.

I got back from Brooks yesterday, spent the 10th thru the 13th there. What a land of enchantment, simply unbelievable. I had to pinch myself a few times to ensure I wasn't dreaming. The weather was amazing, not a cloud in the sky the whole time. Very few people as well. My daughter and I got to witness the return of Otis. We were down on the shore of Naknek Lake on the morning of the twelfth taking photos of the sunrise and he came out of the fog on the spit and was making his way up the lower river and we weren't far behind. We made our way to the falls, stopping at the riffles before heading on up. We were the only ones on the platform and lo and behold here came Otis headed for the falls and so did we. Once again, we were the only ones on the platform at the falls and sweet Otis made it home. What sweet memories I have now.

These pictures were all from the lower river & Naknek Lake. The picture of him in the lake is the only time I have seen him look small and a couple of shots of the fur pattern around his ears (when I was geeking-out one day). Will post more from other years later.\" 480 Otis's fur pattern near his ears are seen in photos #3 and #4. Photo #6 shows Otis with a possible split tongue.  Mike commented on Otis's possible split tongue on 6/7/2021. \"Huh. It does sort of look like that. I'll have to pay closer attention when I'm at Brooks River to confirm whether the tongue is split (certainly a possibility) or if it is just folded weirdly in the photo.\" Shel posted three snapshots of 480 Otis from 9/18/2017 with what appears to be a split tongue, #1, #2 and #3.

About an hour ago, we were talking on the chat about how Otis got his name. One idea was that it was based on the Otis Redding song, \"Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay.\" Turns out that's not the case. But ever since that post, the song has been going through my head. So... Here's the Katmai Otis version of the song. Feel free to sing along!:-) \u201cOtis at Brooks Falls\u201d With Apologies to the great Otis Redding Sittin\u2019 in the mornin\u2019 sun I\u2019ll be sittin\u2019 when the evening comes Watching the fish swim in Then I watch \u2018em swim away again.

The King, Otis Returns!! - Bear Cam Video by Explore Ranger Naomi Boak stopped in chat the evening of 7/26/2021. She shared a story and a photo of 480 Otis. \"So I had just sat down to have a martini at the Lodge, when Ranger Michael came by and said, \"I guess you didn't have your radio on. Ranger Tammy called out that 480 is in the house.\" Needless to say, i abandoned my martini, raced to my cabin to get my gear and ran to the falls. Only problem -- a bear jam. So I went back to the bridge to get in touch with Courtney to let her know and figure how we could let the world know. I actually bushwacked through the trees to get around the sleeping bear and made it to the falls to see SO many bears...and the Zen Master himself, 480 Otis. It's a miracle. I hear the champagne corks popping round the world. \" Ranger Naomi Boak stopped in chat the morning of 7/27/2021 and shared two more photos of 480 Otis in chat, #1 and #2. \"I know we are obsessed with the return of Otis, but his return was the cap to a magical day here. Early in the evening I was sitting on the bridge with Mocha-SoCal and the superintendent. It was so quietly beautiful on the lower river. I mentioned how Holly didn't travel under the bridge until late in the season last year. Not two seconds later, Holly swam right underneath us, then dove for fish! Later in the evening, three rangers (including Ranger Mo) were fishing. A longtime maintenance fellow and I watched and joked with them for a while. Then, I was on the porch of the Lodge, speaking with the woman who works with the walruses at Round Island when I heard the news about Otis. Yes, another magical day at Brooks Camp.

Today was one of those two. Oof. On such days, I checked cams every 30 minutes to see if chat had exploded -- a sure sign of Otis' return. On this particular day, I was with my daughter and her newborn -- it was truly a lovely day! And at exactly 5:55 EDT, as that baby lie sleeping on my lap, I checked BF and... WAIT. THAT'S OTIS. Highlights? No. THAT'S. OTIS! I grabbed a snap, and then I quietly, but swiftly handed off my beloved granddaughter and explained I had to leave. I have to go count fish, I said. I knew my daughter would understand -- she works at a shelter and is an animal lover herself. \u2665 She did.:) And so it began.:) I'm sure y'all, especially those of you who doubted his return, have similar stories you're going to repeat of when and where you were when Otis returned in 2023 -- just like 2021, when he also returned on July 26 -- while he meandered from one cam to the next to come home to us.

Terry Miller (aka sundogsNM) counted 5 fish brought by 907. Terry Miller (aka sundogsNM) recorded 3 of the 5 share sessions.Sharing fish is not a common behavior among brown bears, especially a boar sharing with another boar. A healthy younger boar sharing with a frail aged adult boar has been previously documented at Brooks River one other time....16 Cinnamon in 2011, the final season 16 was observed using the Brooks River. A second observation of this rare brown bear behavior begs some questions, for example: Do brown bears sense things we have not even considered? Do brown bears have the capacity to take care of one another in a desperate time of need with regard to survival? One things these amazing creatures have taught us is that even after all this time, we still have much to learn.: Part 1 - 907 brings fish, 480 Otis protects his scrap, 907 checks it but leaves for more fishing.: 08 Aug 2023- 480 Otis and 907 share, part 1 (explore.org) video by Terry Miller (aka sundogsNM) Part 2 - 907 brings fish number 3, 480 Otis is full but picking at scraps.: 08 Aug 2023- 480 Otis and 970 share fish, part 2 (explore.org) video by Terry Miller (aka sundogsNM) Part 3 - 907 brings fish number 5, 480 Otis seems excited to see 907, but 480 mostly stares at the scraps while 907 eats.: 08 Aug 2023- 480 Otis and 970 share fish, part 3 (explore.org) video by Terry Miller (aka sundogsNM) In addition to the 5 salmon 907 shared with 480 Otis on August 8, 2023, 480 Otis had a successful independent fishing day of his own.

Now of course 480 Otis must consume those fish in view of the live cams along the Brooks River that are available through the partnership between Katmai National Park & Preserve and Explore.org for those fish to be counted. Nature's Folio provides a daily 480 Otis Fishing Report on the website.  OtisFishingReport.com is a collection of Otis Fishing Reports. Otis\u2019 goal? Get fat! Seriously. He yearns to gain enough weight to get through another year of hibernation. And to that end, Otis loves to eat wild Alaskan sockeye salmon. Explore the Secret Sauce page of OtisFishingReport.com to discover what an Otis fishing report is, why the Otis fishing report was started, how to decode the Otis fishing report lingo (abbreviations that appear in the report), and how to comment on the Otis fishing reports.  The origin of 480 Otis' name is not known; it is not recorded in the bear monitoring data base. Sometimes names are just given arbitrarily and Ranger Mike said that he would be willing to bet that is the case with Otis...someone just liked that name Otis.  ...After more investigative magic by Mike Fitz...the answer is revealed! On 7/4/2019 during a Play-by-Play at Brooks Falls, Mike Fitz explained how 480 got his nickname . Mike said \"This is number 480, he is nicknamed Otis. He got that nickname actually because of the shape of his ears, just oval shaped ears. Maybe it doesn't make that much sense to go from oval shape to Otis but that is how he got his nickname.\"  Unfortunately the video of the 07/04/19 play-by-play, linked above, is not currently available. Fortunately Mazey had transcribed the above information from that play-by-play and added it to the wiki. THANK YOU MAZEY for preserving the answer to the frequently asked question: \"How did 480 Otis get his nickname?\"! 480 Otis has almost mastered keeping his courting and mating behaviors from being captured by cam viewers and park visitors (or at least he has benefited from much of it being hard to locate for sharing). However, a little is now known about 480's reproductive adventures: 2017.07.09: 480 Otis courting an adult female video by Brenda D.Note: Video unavailable as of 2021.

Anna-Marie shared some additional information about her photo: The photo \"was taken from the Treehouse. Otis and the female (might be 289) were under the walkway between the treehouse and the riffles platform \". \"Right after the mating, both bears showed up down by the riffles and moved up toward the Falls. Another bear followed her up the path on the other side of the river and then Otis followed them! \" Please request Anna-Marie's permission prior to using her photos! 708 Amelia was observed being courted by 480 OtisbetweenJune 21, 2018andJuly 9, 2018.: Please request Mocha's permission prior to using her photos! 480 Otis is currently not known to have sired any offspring that use the Brooks River, In 2005 - 2006a geneticsstudy was done by collecting hair and tissue samples;no known offspring of 480 Otis were discovered.

Popeye saw the movement and went in for the capture ....he went out of frame as he pounced. So we didn't see if he was successful or not. He was gone about 5 minutes. Minutes after he returned he was violently ill....not the usual salmon colour.....but a very dark substance. Guess you could call it \"Otter's Revenge\".     Video by Brenda D.

Could 410 be the mother of 634 Popeye?: \"I know that 410 day isn\u2019t until the 19th but while looking through my 2016 snapshots for pics of 409, I found some of 410. But what I noticed immediately looking at some of the pics is that her she has a \u201c crabby\u201d face and what struck me is that 634 Popeye has her very same expression. Lips etc aren\u2019t the same but there\u2019s a lot that is the same. Is there a possibility that Popeye is her son? I don\u2019t know if she had any male coy that lived?\" Kisper Samoyed made the same observation some time ago:  \"I noticed that some time age and sent an email to Ranger Michael to see if our thoughts are correct. No answer as of now.\" KCanada replied to GreenRiver:  \"He was first identified as an \u201colder subadult\u201d in 2002, so if he were a cub of hers it would have to be her 1998 litter where she had one coy. I have no idea what became of that cub, though or what its gender was. ...\" GreenRiver shared these snapshots:  \"Well, When I saw this one pic of 410, it just reminded me of Popeye. So I did find a snapshot of Popeye from this past season. I just think they look similar. Maybe it\u2019s just because they both seem to be frowning in these pics.:)I know I\u2019ve seen other pics that look like he is frowning.\" Add here A special thank you to StMango for the NPS photos from the 2012 Brown Bears of Brooks Camp iBook.

From Meet Bear 854 Divot video: Watch this Meet Bear 854 Divot video by Mike Fitz, Resident Naturalist with Explore.org to learn identification and distinctive behaviors that will help you identify 854 Divot. Meet Bear 854 Divot - Bears of Brooks Falls by Mike Fitz, Resident Naturalist with Explore-0 2018 Bears of Brooks River book:Over the past several years, her use of the river has varied considerably. In some years (2013) she used the river infrequently, while in others (fall 2014) she was seen almost daily. As a young bear, she was often seen at the mouth of Brooks River in May digging in exposed gravel, apparently attracted to those spots by rotten scraps of salmon from the previous year. The divots she left in the gravel inspired her nickname. 854 has learned to associated people with fish. In the lower Brooks River, she will often sit or lie on the shore while people fish nearby. She often looks like she is resting and not paying attention to the water, but when someone hooks a fish, she quickly enters the water in pursuit of an easy meal. Each time a bear takes a fish from someone\u2019s fishing line it reinforces that behavior. The bear is then more likely to approach people in the future with the idea of obtaining food. 854 Divot's year of birth. 854 Divot is the 2002 offspring of 216 Marilyn and 24 BB (aka Bald Butt) .

Mission to save Bear 854, Divot, from a wolf snare, video by Katmai National Park and Preserve 2014.07.29: 2014.07.29 - 2014.07.30: Katmai rangers kept bearcam viewers updated on the mission to save 854 Divot. Part of those updates came via this Explore.org blog: Update on Divot the bear \"Update on Divot the BearFrom theBear CamRangers in Katmai National Park: Earlier today, many of you saw the sow with a single cub at the Lower River. That is believed to have been Divot, 854, now with only one cub. That alone would be news, but it also appears that she has been caught in a wolf snare, broken free, but still has the snare around her neck. From the photos we have, it looks as if it has cut into her neck. Our plan is to attempt to tranquilize her on Tuesday and remove the snare. This is a long shot, as she has not been routinely seen this year and we may not even be able to locate her. Perhaps with fewerBrooks Campvisitors and a fair number of salmon around she will linger just a while longer. Keep your fingers crossed. Update at 2pm PST:Divot\u2019s Last Known Location\u2013 see photo above. From Ranger Roy, \u201cDivot and cub were seen a few hours ago near Brooks Camp, but have since moved to the creek on the north side of Dumping Mountain and have disappeared into the forest. The biologist who will do the darting is almost here. If she continues up the creek to fish it will nearly be impossible to track her. let\u2019s hope she moves back down to the beach where she can be seen. Unfortunately, the winds are also picking up, which greatly complicates matters. Update at 7pm PST:From Ranger Jeanne, \u201cHere is a map [see above] that depicts the locations where 854 Divot was seen. On July 12, I took photos of 854 Divot on the Brooks River. On July 24, bearcam viewer CalliopeJane took a photo of 854 Divot somewhere between Big Creek and Naknek River Camp. I do not have the exact GPS coordinates of the location where CalliopeJane took the photo. The GPS point on the map marks Divot\u2019s location earlier today. When she was first seen this morning, she was on the road moving in the direction of the Brooks Falls trailhead. She traveled down Brooks River, onto the gravel bar, on the beach to Mortuary Point and around the north shore of Dumpling Mountain in just a few hours. The last I heard from Ranger Mike around noon today, she had gone into the woods near the GPS point. Hopefully Rangers Roy and Mike will have an update later tonight.\u201d Update at 7:30 pm PST:From Ranger Roy, \u201cHello all: We are back, and despite seeing Divot and cub briefly, we were unsuccessful at tranquilizing her. Here is what happened: This morning, Divot and cubs were seen at about 8:30am at Lake Brooks, Rangers began following her on foot and continue dot do so until she reached Dumpling Creek. She and her cub were last seen fishing Dumpling Creek around 11:00am, and then disappeared up the creek. Around 1:30, we arrived on scene with the biologist that is licensed to administer tranquilizers. We did a sweep of the heavily forested and steep terrain, and while we saw recent evidence of bear activity, we saw neither of them. We returned to the boats and waited. One boat patrolled the lakeshore looking for her, the other waited where she was last seen. After about 90 minutes, we were preparing to leave and we saw her a few hundred yards down the beach. She rapidly closed the distance faster than we could prepare for the shot and she went right up the creek again. Even if we had been ready we may not have taken the shot because having her head back of the creek again while tranquilized would have made it difficult for us to deal with her and locate her. The park plane was in the area and flew the creek and observed that she continued up the creek. We waited for her return, but had to call it off because after tranquilizing a bear, it takes about 4 hours for them to be fully in control again, and it would have put us out there after dark. We will continue looking for her early Wednesday morning around camp, and will also go back to her little salmon fishing paradise, too. I was unable to read too far into the thousands of comments, but I get the idea that some have speculated that we have received resistance from above. That is absolutely false. We requested assistance from our regional office and received it within minutes. The perceived delay was not because of red tape, it was purely logistical\u2013Nothing happens fast in bush Alaska. We did not have to get permission from anyone to address the issue, we simply had to locate people with the necessary skills and equipment and then transport them to one of the most remote places on earth, hence the 24hr delay. The wire that is around her neck may be a snare, or it may be something else. We won\u2019t know for sure until we remove it. Trapping is not allowed in the park, but this sow and cub are easily capable of traveling outside the park in a few days. There is currently no reason to jump to the conclusion that there is poaching in the park. If it is indeed a snare, it may have been accidentally left behind last winter. Trapping is generally done for furs, and this is the wrong season for that. Too much shedding going on. I will probably edit this again, but I wanted to get an update to you all as soon as possible. Please do not assume that something nefarious is going on when we are silent. We had 8 people on the ground and three in a plane looking for her. All who have been involved in attempting this rescue have Divot\u2019s best interest at heart at all times.\u201d Update 7/30 at 10am PST: From Ranger Roy, \u201cDivot was just spotted and we are off to try again. It may be hours before my next update, so please be patient and try not to get sucked into too much speculation. I will give you a full report upon my return.\u201d Update 7/30 at 7pm PST:Today, rangers and biologist tranquilized and treated a female bear with a wire snare tightly wound around her neck. The snare was removed and an iodine-like liquid (betadine) was applied to her wound.Look for a live chat with Ranger Roy and Mike about this situation later this week, or join the discussion now in the comments stream on the #bearcam.\" 2014.07.30: Ranger Grant Hilderbrand, NPS Wildlife Biologistand his team of KNP&P rangers successfully locate, sedate, and removed the wire snare from 854 Divot's neck Mission to Save 854 Divot video: Mission to save Bear 854, Divot, from a wolf snare by KNP&P 2014.08.04: Katmai Terrane Blog: Removing a Wire Snare from 854 Divot by Ranger Mike Fitz. 854 Divot and her remaining yearling can be seen in front of the lower river platform in this September 2014 video by Anna-Marie_AZ.

I have two Divot stories to share from my time volunteering at Katmai in July. 1) Every morning, I would wake up early (around 4:20 a.m.) and walk down to the beach at Naknek Lake. Since I was alone, I would sing (usually Beatles classics), to let the bears know I was coming.:-) One morning, it was kind of dark. I was walking down the trail to the beach, singing -- and suddenly I heard a \"huff\" just in front of me! Suddenly, a bear: Close enough to touch! (Though I didn't.) I jumped back, still singing -- and realizing that I'd woken up a BEAR that had been sleeping by the side of the trail! I backed up, still singing, and saying, \"You're okay, bear, you're okay.\" And I walked back from the beach to my housing. The bear stayed where it was and, I think, went back to sleep. I learned later that the bear was 854 Divot! She'd dug a sleeping hole on the side of the trail -- directly across from one of the ranger's cabins -- and had been sleeping there when I walked by. What I learned: Bears can move from sleeping to standing VERY quickly.:-) 2) Here is my second 854 Divot story: I was at Katmai for six weeks -- and only ONCE did I hear a bear coming. I was standing by the Ranger's Station, talking to one of the rangers -- the same morning that I'd woken up 854 on the trail. As we chatted, I suddenly heard (and felt) the sound of running bears. The ranger and I jumped up onto the porch of the Rangers Station -- just in time to see 854 chasing a subadult down the trail where the ranger and I had just been standing. (If we hadn't jumped up on the porch, the bears would've knocked us over.) What I learned; Bears normally walk VERY quietly. It's kind of astounding how soft their tread is. But when they run, they can move VERY fast. Thanks, 854 Divot, for the good and important lessons! \" Stacey also shared these two 2018 season memories of 854 Divot: \"Two other memories of 854 Divot from this summer: 1) She liked to nap -- and we would often see her sleeping under a tree very near the Riffles platform.She seemed comfortable being near the platform, even when it was crowded. 2) One very warm day, she feel asleep in the river, just to the left of the Riffles platform. Her head was above water, but her belly was completely submerged. Some people were worried about her! But I think she was just trying to stay cool. I wondered if the Riffles cam was able to see her sleeping in the water.\" Park visitor, Tommy Hays captured these photographs of 854 during the 2018 season: Photo #1 854 , #2 854 & #3 854 .

A sow with a single spring cub purused the lower river, fishing and coming into brief conflict with bear 854 and her two coy. Bear 854 seemed to find success in fishing at Lake Brooks.

We suspect that #500 is one of #409 Beadnose's most recent litter, but we can't be 100% sure without hard scientific evidence. We did have a DNA study done a number of years ago that told us some interesting things. For example, we know that #854 Divot's father and grandfather were the same bear, whom we have not seen in a number of years. In some cases cubs have distinct features (like #130 Tundra's scar) which we can use to identify them as they grow older and leave their mother. Next year we hope to begin a new DNA study that will give us some new scientific data and confirm some of our suspicions about who is related to whom.\" LTC asks: \"So would that mean that BB #24 is also Marilyn #216's father?\" Ranger Aaron Camire's October 7, 2014 15:51 comment \"Yes\": Ranger Aaron Camire's October 7, 2014 16:38 comment: \"There is some interbreeding. #24 BB was #854's father and grandfather. We know this through genetic studies that were done a few years ago, and we are planning to start a new genetics program next year. When bears get kicked out by their mother, they sometimes disperse to other areas. This especially true for young males- females tend to stay in the same area they were raised. This probably helps to avoid inbreeding somewhat. It's also important to keep in mind when young bears don't return to the area.\" 854 Divot, 790 Weevil Bear, 24 BB and 216 Marily were all successfully sampled between 2005and 2007 during Ranger Tamara Olson's genetics study. 854 Divot was successfully darted by Ranger Michael Saxton on October 5, 2016.

He also fishes the falls in September and October.747 does not appear to be wary of people on the viewing platforms near Brooks Falls and is sometimes seen near the mouth of the Brooks River. In years past, he was rarely seen in areas with high numbers of people.747 was not regularly seen at Brooks Falls until fall.

She would fish the falls, with impunity from other bears, under their protective guard.....and took full advantage of that fact....day, after day, after day.;))) She had not been seen with a new litter of cubs since 2007.Have often wondered, was she courting for procreation, or open access to her favourite fishing spot???Why would she follow them?

At the 2:30 mark when the live cam widens the view, 410 can be seen fishing in the far pool and it becomes visible that 747 has also taken notice of 814 Lurch's arrival on the scene. 83 Wayne Brother holds his position on the North side remaining close to or on the bank. 747 displays his cowboy walk as he heads in the direction of 814 Lurch. At the 2:50 mark 89 Backpack begins his retreat to the top of the falls. At the 3:09 mark, 83 Wayne Brother begins his retreat up the hill on the North side of the river below the falls.

At 3:32 89 Backpack moves from his seated position on the rock and heads up river. 410 also begins to move from the far pool and also makes her way above the falls as 747 comes closer. At 3:43, 814 Lurch moves down river towards the island. At 4:04 410 moves closer to the edge of the falls with 747 still remaining in the far pool. 89 Backpack makes his retreat out of view. At 4:40, 410 begins to test the option of returning to the far pool but by 4:47 as 747 moves in her direction, she rethinks that option and backs off a bit. When 410 determines that it is safe she does climb back down from above the falls and 747 continues to court 410. At 5:45, 747 takes a seat and guards 410 while she fishes in the far pool.

Read my full breakdown of the video\" at Mike Fitz' October 14, 2016 blog: Strut Your Stuff .\"In the video, 747 is the heftier, darker bear. 68 is the tall, lanky bear. Both are mature adult males, likely in the prime of their lives. As I see it, bear 747 comes out of this on top as he asserts his dominance over the newcomer, 68. This took some time, however. 68 didn\u2019t exactly yield like most would upon the approach of 747.As the video starts, 747 (left) immediately approaches the newcomer on the island. 68 subtly skirts 747, but continues his approach toward the falls. You can see that 747 is much bulkier than the newcomer, but the new bear is just as tall, if not taller.:When 747 turns his back on the new bear, 68 takes the opportunity to mark some grass (0:50). 68 is not acting submissive or yielding.The new bear approaches 747. 747 stands and watches. At this point, the outcome is very much undecided (1:12).After a little more posturing, 747 turns to mark the willow on the island. This is a bold display of dominance in front of 68. The newcomer though continues to cowboy walk away from 747, still not submissive but very focused on 747\u2019s movements (2:00).747 follows the exact same route on the island as 68, probably following the newcomer\u2019s scent and leaving his own on the way (2:20). 68 postures more in the grass. 747 again marks the tree. This time for almost 30 seconds (3:18).747 then goes to the grass where 68 just was and rubs it on his body. He seems to want to leave a scenttrail everywhere his competitor has (4:05).68 walks downriver. 747 follows. In the riffles, 747 catches up to him. Instead of fighting, the bears posture more. Here\u2019s where 747 seems to assert his dominance more clearly. 68, instead of posturing further, stands in the riffles and watches 747 approach then walk away (5:00).The video cuts to a moment a few minutes later when 68 makes his way back to the island. This draws 747\u2019s attention and he approaches 68 again. 747\u2019s ears remain upright and forward, a sign of dominance in this context. The new bear\u2019s ears are oriented back against his head, a sign of defensiveness (6:40).747 circles 68. 747 walks away and the newcomer stands and watches, indicating that 747 successfully asserted his dominance in the interaction. 747 then goes back to the island and marks the vegetation again (7:05). 68 continues to stand and watch.

Bears on Kodiak and the Alaska Peninsula are famous for their size and 747 ranks among the largest brown bears on Earth. Adult males in Katmai average 700-900 lbs in mid summer. 747, however, tips the scales on the heavy side of that. It's no exaggeration to estimate his weight at 900-1000 lbs right now. Last fall,his weight was estimated at an astounding 1,400 lbs.

One more 856 story: It was July 2019 (I think), around 6 p.m. I'd been volunteering on the Brooks Falls platform, and had stayed after my shift to watch the bears. The platform was unusually empty; it was the rare quiet hour between the daytime crowd and the nighttime crowd when most visitors had left to get dinner. So it was me and a younger couple on the platform, watching the bears. 856 and 747 were fishing at the falls, and there was a young female bear fishing in the riffles. 747 decided to go down to the riffles to say hello to the female. And suddenly, 856 decided he was interested in her, too. The poor female (I didn't recognize her, but she seemed very young) made a quick getaway. 747 decided to follow -- until 856 decided he wasn't happy about that, and started pursuing 747. From the Riffles, 747 (followed by 856) moved up toward the falls. Then the two boars marched toward the BF platform (where the couple and I stood watching, agape). They went up to our left, toward the fish ladder, then UP THE HILL behind the platform, so that they stood at eye level to us: 856 following 747, not running, but in deliberate pursuit, sending a message. Poor 747 moved behind the platform and into the woods on the right side of the platform (where BF low sometimes looks backward into the woods). We saw 747 emerge into the riffles, 856 still walking deliberately behind. They repeated their circle of the BF platform -- once again standing eye level to us, just a few yards away. I have never been so transfixed. Eventually, the two bears disappeared into the woods by the Riffles. At that point, the three of us started breathing again. We felt like we had witnessed the most incredible bear activity of the day -- and only the three of us had seen it. At the end of this, the couple needed to get back to the lodge for dinner -- but we were well aware that the two bears had disappeared into the woods near the riffles, and we really didn't want to encounter them on the Brooks Falls Trail! So we hung out for a little bit, giving the bears time to disperse, then walked back down the BF Trail together, talking loudly all the way so that the bears knew we were there. And guess what: We DID encounter a bear on the trail! But it was the female that they'd initially been interested in -- not the two males. An exciting -- and breathtaking -- display of dominance. We felt so privileged to have experienced this. On 2/21/2021 scooch replied to Stacey's story: \"Hi Stacey! That incident that you described may be part of these two gifs that I recorded on July 6, 2019.

Yet, the bears still didn\u00b4t know they were not going to find dinner in Brooks River that day and, to my luck and delight, the most part of the Big Boys showed up at the falls that evening. 83 Wayne Brother was one of them. He entered the river near the riffles area and walked slowly toward the falls. 32 Chunk in the Jacuzzi, 755 Scare D Bear in the far pool and 747 on the conveyor belt were the bears hanging out at the falls when he approached. He stood by the \u201chole\u201d for a few seconds, but as soon as 747 saw him, the bear of colossal proportions decided to remind 83 Wayne Brother he was the top bear at the falls while 856 was not around.  They both exchanged some harsh words, and when 747 felt it was enough, he turned around and left. 83 Wayne Brother sat and stared at 747 wondering what he had done to deserve that. After a few seconds, he decided it was better to find dinner somewhere else.\" Pictures taken on July 7, 2019 Olatz Azcona Mun\u00e1rriz shared six additional 7/7/2019 photos of 747 0n 4/3/2022, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5 and #6. \"747 was the only boar I saw catching a couple of salmon at the falls during my first evening in Brooks River on July 7, 2019. He was not so lucky two days later, on July 9, when he also spent some time at the falls while I stood on the platform. That evening, he only got harsh words and a display of dominance on the island from 856, the top bear in Brooks River that year.\" Please request Olatz Azcona Mun\u00e1rriz's permission prior to using their photographs!

Stacey's calm demeanor and communication with other Rangers on the radio can be seen in the 2 videos posted.On 1/22/2020 at 05:18 Stacey shared her experience while assisting two visitors on the Brooks Falls trail.Park visitor Sunion81 filmed the 2 videos. In Instagramvideo #1,2 subadults (901 and possibly 821 or his sister 831) are walking on the trail, sense 747's approach and quickly run forward. Invideo #2,747 comes lumbering by at a normal pace, probably only interested in getting to the falls to fish. \"STORYMazey posted a video yesterday from my time volunteering at Brooks in July. And that led me to a second video that was posted this morning. Here's the story behind those videos. It was the second or third week of July 2019 -- a Wednesday, I think -- and on this day I was volunteering on the Brooks Falls platform. It was early in the morning -- around 8 or 9 a.m. AK time -- and I was the first person assigned to the BF platform shift. I'd arrived at the platform, dropped off my gear, and then walked back to the Falls Trail for my first assignment -- a 90-minute \"rove\" on the Falls Trail. (A rove is when you walk around an area -- assisting guests, answering questions, and just generally being visible.) As I exited the platform to the Brooks Falls trail, I saw two guests -- I'll call them Juan and Maria -- smiling, and walking briskly up the trail in my direction. From Spain, they were halfway through their three-day stay at Brooks Camp, and they were excited to be among the first viewers on the platform in the a.m. We recognized each other (I'd met them the day before), and we exchanged friendly greetings. And suddenly, I heard the sound of running bears behind me. I looked over my shoulder, and saw two subadults running down the hill. They skidded to a halt, and started play fighting right in front of the BF gate! Juan immediately reached for his camera, as I told the couple we needed to move quickly off the trail. We stepped into the woods off the trail where we'd met, about 20 yards away from the play fighting bears. This was NOT a situation I wanted to be in! I'd encountered bears on the trail before -- single bears, subadult bears, moms with cubs-- but I'd never been that close to a pair of play fighting subadults before. As Juan filmed the bears, I explained what was happening -- that these young bears (the teenagers of the bear world) were play fighting with each other -- and asked the guests to move as far back on the trail as they could, since the bears were paying attention to each other, and not to us. I was concerned that at some point, the play fighting would stop and the bears would run down the trail, knocking down anyone who happened to be in their way. And then, suddenly, a new development: \"The situation has changed,\" I said to Juan and Maria. \"I see a big bear -- Bear 747 -- walking toward the gate from the river. These two subadults don't know he's there yet. But when they see him -- or smell him -- they're going to run. So let's push even further back into the forest if we can.\" Still filming, Juan and Maria moved further back into the forest, away from the trail. At that point, someone called out from down the trail, maybe 20 yards further away from the gate than us. It was a ranger -- hooray! She'd heard me talking to Juan and Maria, and she wanted me to know that she could hear me, even though we couldn't see each other. \"You're doing great,\" she said. \"Just keeping talking, and have your bear spray ready.\" \"I don't have bear spray,\" I sighed. As I watched 747 walk slowly toward the gate -- and the playing bears -- I reminded Juan and Maria of what we'd learned in bear school. \"Let's keep talking,\" I said. \"I know you're from Spain, and you can speak Spanish if you want to. I'm pretty sure these bears speak Spanish.\" So in the background of the first video, you can hear me narrating -- partly to keep calm, partly so the bears would know where we were, and partly so that the ranger down the trail would know what was happening. And you can hear Juan and Maria speaking Spanish, too. Once the play fighting subadults saw 747, they left the gate and starting heading down the trail in front of us -- walking at first, and then running (as I thought they might) to get away from 747. But things weren't over yet! Once a bear walks past, a visitor's first instinct is often to hurry out of the woods and back onto the trail. But that was NOT a good option here, especially since I had a hunch that 747 would follow the less dominant bears down the trail. So we waited in the woods -- still talking -- until Bear 747 went past. And that's what you see in the second video. Once the ranger advised that 747 was 50 yards down the trail, we exited the woods, checked our surroundings, met up with the ranger, and walked together toward the BF gate. It was an exciting beginning to an eventful day. As I recall, there were, at one point, more than a dozen bears on the trail that day -- subadults, moms with cubs, 747, etc. They caused multiple bear jams and kept the rangers busy. I'm grateful to Juan and Maria for paying attention in bear school. And grateful, too, for the ranger, who managed things from down the trail.It's not a situation I wanted to be in, but I'll remember it for a long time -- not just because of the bears, but also because of the people involved.

I pulled the curtain back to see a brown bear quickly digging a hole near the foundation. I started filming through the thin panes of glass and then as the bear rolled over I remembered our bear training to let the bears do what they do so stepped away. I learned later that seeing the curtain opening was good to prevent him from doing further digging. Anyway, this is 747 who won Katmai NP\u2019s Fat Bear Week last year so a bit of a celebrity sighting as well. I\u2019ll never forget the time I was less than a couple of feet from a brown .\" 2021.05.26:   Ranger Naomi stopped in chat on 5/28/2021.

I walked swiftly back to camp to find the bear tech on duty to tell her that 747 was heading to camp. And head to camp he did, sauntering from the lower river to the beach and in and out of the woods. On the way, he decided to let others know he had been around.

Thank you for all your kind words. Here's a big guy who wasn't in the 8...probably because the best face pics I got of him this summer were likely (?) posted months ago. At any rate, this first one is of 747 walking through camp, probably because Tinder was down. Unfortunately, both of these pics had to be taken through a window...and that's especially evident in this first one. But I like it because it's a reminder of what might be right outside your cabin door.

We were walking down the trail when this large boar emerged from the woods. We parted to the side and he started up the path to the falls, stopped and turned around. I was standing alone and the bear walked within a foot of me and made eye contact. I could smell him. I could hear him breathing. He paused briefly then kept walking down the trail. I have never had an experience like that. I was both mesmerized and terrified at the same time. It was incredible.  After talking with rangers and other Katmai bear fans, it was decided this bear is 747, the winner of the 2020 fat bear contest. \" Note: This account has been made private. 2021.06.25:  747 stopped by the falls the evening of 6/25/2021, video by JG.

Not catching anything, he retired up the hill. He came back to the J a short time later and caught a fish. Instead of his usual routine of taking it to the island to eat he went up the fish ladder to consume it. That is when 747 showed up. Chatter FatBearChamp747 gives a verbal play-by-play below. FatBearChamp747 described their interpretation of the first interaction between 747 and 856. \"Went back and watched the 1st confrontation between 747 & 856 and it was even more amazing than the 2nd one - 856 Finally catches a salmon in they J - Yay the salmon are back! - but instead of eating it in the J or by the Island like he normally does, 856 climbed the ladder and went above the falls to eat his catch by 812's dinner rock - was the King of the Falls the last 10 years actually worried about getting his Salmon stolen? - then 747 climbs the ladder and approaches 856, he doesn't try to steal his fish buts puts on a full dominance display - with two tree markings above the Falls and one below by the viewing platform for good measure as he left (beginning to understand how 747 got those racing stripes on his back) maybe this is why 856 has been so anxious for the Salmon to come, he knows he is not as big as 747 is right now, maybe it won't last but at least for the moment it does look like there is a new sheriff in town.\" FatBearChamp's subsequent comment. \"OMG the crushing down of the tree as 747 approached 856 - lol - it's King Kong vs Godzilla and King Kong won the first two rounds - 747 was not intimidated by 856 even a little bit, maybe 747 will pay fir this insubordination later in the season but for now it sure does look like there has been a change at the top.\" Mike Fitz gave his interpretation of the events. \"That was quite an interesting confrontation between 747 and 856, two of the river's largest and most dominant bears. Initially, I couldn't tell if 747 approached 856 because he wanted some of 856's salmon or if 747 was just feeling strong enough to challenge 856 for dominance. Either way, 747 demonstrated some boldness by directly approaching 856 and marking trees in front of him. After 747 moved away, 856 reciprocated a bit and also marked some of the trees near the fish ladder. However, I would score that confrontation as a draw. No bear seemed to yield to the other and much of their behavior was obscured by vegetation. But about 10 minutes later, 747 directly approaches 856 below the falls. 856 yields upon 747's approach! Then 747 turns his back and walks away. Since this wasn't a conflict over a fishing spot then it's a clear indication that 747 \"won\" the interaction and at the moment can be considered more dominant. If we see 856 yield to 747 again, then we'll know there has been a shift in the hierarchy. For more than a decade, 747 has yielded to 856. That may have just changed.\" Blair-55 posted this gif of the 747 (left) and 856 (right) interaction. Mike Fitz commented about the two boars body language a short time later. after viewing Blair's gif. \"This captures the interaction well. 747: Head up, ears forward, direct approach--all signs of dominance. 856: Head slightly lowered, ears back, walking backwards while opponent approaches--all signs of submission.\" Hey Princess's 6/28/2021 video that captures both interactions. 856 and 747 confrontation display of dominance Explore.org 06.28.21 Video by Hey Princess GA Bear's 6/28/2021 video that captures the jacuzzi interaction.

According to msn, Cara Siciliano (Mrsb111) is the park visitor that captured the above video of 747.  According to Right This Minute, Cara Siciliano is known as Mrsb111 on tik tok.  Right This Minute also discusses Explore.org in their segment that included Cara Siciliano's video of 747.   Mike Fitz, Resident Naturalist with Explore.org and former KNP&P Ranger, shared this interpretation of 747's behavior observed in the above videos by Mrsb111 and Cozy Club.  Mike also shared some best practices for park visitors to utilize to increase safety (for both park visitors and the bears) while cohabitating with the bears of Brooks River.:   \"In the video, 747 was stressed. You can hear him jaw-popping when he turned around. His vocalizations and movement could've been a reaction to the presence of people or something else. I'm not sure.   One note I would like to add about getting off the trail: While it is important to give bears the right-of-way, it equally important to give bears as much space as possible. That means getting off the trail as far as you can before the bear is close by. However, separating yourself from the bear's space isn't always possible due to the design of trails at Brooks River. The forest behind the group recording the video is quite thick, for example. They might not have had time to move off the road before 747 was too close. In a situation when it doesn't seem like you have time to move away safely, then standing your ground and letting the bear choose how it will avoid you is often a good decision. Situations like these are common at Brooks Camp. With the exception of the wildlife viewing platforms most infrastructure at Brooks Camp, including the trails, are not designed or well placed to separate people from bears. Most bears at Brooks Camp expect to encounter people on trails, though, so sticking to the trails and roads can certainly help increase your safety. Along with staying on designated trails, I encourage anyone who visits Brooks Camp to hike in groups, remain  aware of your surroundings to the best of your ability, and plan ahead for what you will do in a surprise encounter.\" DanteV2000 shared the two following photographs (#1 & #2) that show the location of the park visitors and 747 and provide a visual perspective that while not available in the park visitor's video, demonstrates Mike Fitz' comment about the limited area the park visitors had available to them to yield space to 747.  This is also a very good example of how what we are able to see in a video, in a photograph, or on the live cams does not always tell us everything we need to know to understand what exactly we are seeing.: Giant Bear Casually Walks Past Tourists in Alaska's Katmai National Park 747 in 2021 (August 3, 2021 or prior) by Cara Siciliano via Storyful Fun Fact:  The KNP&P sign that 747 appears to look at in the above video, the one that sits at the Brooks Falls trailhead, was painted by Sara Wolman, former KNP&P Ranger.  You can see it as a work in progress on Sara's October 17, 2016 instagram post. On August 10, 2021 at 12:37 AKDT during the live comment chat on the dedicated Live Chat cam comments, Mike Fitz, also shared this information about the above video by Cara Siciliano.: \"To begin, I'd like to address a video recorded at Brooks Camp that has recently gone viral.   In case you haven't seen it, the video shows bear 747--the largest adult male at Brooks River--walking within a few feet of a group of people standing on the side of the road near the Brooks Falls trailhead. 747 walks past the group, then turns around near the falls trailhead. Many reactions to the video ranged from surprise to outrage. On the other hand I--having experienced similar situations as a ranger and visitor--had a different response. I was not surprised at all. When asked about it, I initially provided a bit of a muted response. In the video, 747 was stressed. You can hear him jaw-popping when he turned around. His vocalizations and movement could've been a reaction to the presence of people or something else. I'm not sure. One note I would like to add about getting off the trail: While it is important to give bears the right-of-way, it equally important to give bears as much space as possible. That means getting off the trail as far as you can before the bear is close by. However, separating yourself from the bear's space isn't always possible due to the design of trails at Brooks River. The forest behind the group recording the video is quite thick, for example. They might not have had time to move off the road before 747 was too close. In a situation when it doesn't seem like you have time to move away safely, then standing your ground and letting the bear choose how it will avoid you is often a good decision. Situations like these are common at Brooks Camp. With the exception of the wildlife viewing platforms most infrastructure at Brooks Camp, including the trails, are not designed or well placed to separate people from bears. Most bears at Brooks Camp expect to encounter people on trails, though, so sticking to the trails and roads can certainly help increase your safety. Along with staying on designated trails, I encourage anyone who visits Brooks Camp to hike in groups, remain aware of your surroundings to the best of your ability, and plan ahead for what you will do in a surprise encounter. During the mandatory bear orientation at Brooks Camp, rangers emphasize to visitors the importance of giving bears the right-of-way. To do that, it is often necessary to step out of a bear's line of travel as far as you can safely, and take that action as soon as possible. Sometimes that means backing away to a safer location where you can take shelter (a wildlife-viewing platform or building, for example). Sometimes that means stepping off the trail or road with the goal to maintain at least 50 yards of space between you and bear. And, sometimes during a surprise encounter that means getting out of its pathway as best you can, even if that's only a few feet. The first two options are ideal and preferred over the last. So Mike, could the people have moved farther away? Should they have? Maybe, although there are a couple of factors to consider. 1. 747 may have surprised them. They may only have had time to move to the edge of the road. 2. There might have been members of the group who were not physically capable of walking off trail into the forest, even for a short distance. Since I can't see evidence to the contrary in the video, then I think it is appropriate to give their position on the edge of the road the benefit of the doubt. One thing you'll hear in the video is someone repeatedly saying \"Hey bear.\" Talking in a normal tone of voice to your group about what to do is appropriate, of course. It's also appropriate to talk to a bear to inform it that you are a person. However, while it is appropriate to let a bear know you are there, once a bear is aware of your presence you generally do not need to make extra noise as it could provoke a defensive response. Exceptions to this would be if the bear is overtly curious or food-conditioned. Then you'd want to make extra noise. When I discussed the video with Ranger Naomi, she brought up a good point that I should have communicated before. That is, in those situations your priority should not be photographs or video. Focus on the bear's behavior instead, so that you can respond as quickly as possible to any changes. Smart phones aren't to blame here. Trying to record the close proximity of a bear has been in the mindset of people at Brooks Camp for decades. The temptation will be there if you experience it, trust me, so if you are ever in a similar situation reconsider the urge to use your phone or camera. Focus your mind on the bear's actions first and foremost. I also want to make one thing clear: similar scenarios happen many times per day at Brooks River in July and September. That is not an exaggeration. It happens on the trails as well as with anglers and photographers who venture into the river. Brooks River is a loosely regulated bear-viewing site compared to McNeil River, Pack Creek, and Anan Creek. During July there can be hundreds of people at Brooks Camp, dozens of bears using the same area, and far too few rangers to manage it all. The next time a close encounter video goes viral from Brooks Camp, don't be surprised.

This name does not appear in any of the Bears of Brooks River books. It does appear on the KNP&P Flickr Galleries . Ranger Roy Wood provides some insight into how 747 got this nickname Colbert at approximately 23:38 intothis live chat from Luray, Virginia on November 8, 2017 .: Life as a National Park Ranger w Ranger Roy - Brown Bear Live Chat 11 08 17 747's Colbert nickname was inspired by the ear imperfectionhe shares with Stephen Colbert. 747's right ear was a little different than his left ear, it was asymmetrical, it sort of stuck out a little bit. If you watch Stephen Colbert you will see that his ear also has a little outward, downward...it's different from his other ear. 747's misshapen ear was an identification tool the rangers used to identify 747 before he grew into his identification number.Stephen Colbert points out a lot that his ears don't match up, so rangers using Colbert to remind them which bear was 747 when trying to identify the bears probably does not hurt Stephen's feelings.After 747 lost the 2021 Fat Bear Week competition during season 7 of Late Night with Stephen Colbert, Stephen Colbert learned why 747 is nicknamed \"Colbert\" (the 2021 Fat Bear Week segment begins at approximately 8:00 into the video).

In early summer, her coat is dark blonde to light brown. In fall, her coat is brown with some grizzled fur on her head and shoulders. Her ears are light tipped and lean slightly forward. Her face is easily distinguished from other bears by the inverted V pattern of fur on her forehead. In July and fall, she will fish throughout the Brooks River. Until she arrived at Brooks River with cubs in 2014, she appeared to be somewhat habituated to people and would often walk by anglers in the lower river. Her behavior was noticeably different with cubs. Instead of tolerating people, she often avoids them. Bears possess the ability to change their behavior to best fit the circumstances. In this case 132 may have altered her behavior in order to give her cubs a greater level of protection.This has advantages and disadvantages. Bears who are consistently tolerant of people at Brooks River can fish for salmon at all times, but bears that are not tolerant of people avoid the river when people are present. For some bears, people can be seen as a threat or a competitor even if that is not our intention.When raising cubs, does 132 face a disadvantage because of her apparent intolerance of people? Bears who are sonsistently tolerant of people (like adult females 273. 409 Beadnose, and 410) at Brooks River can fish for salmon at all times, but bears that are not tolerant of people ~ those who are not habituated to humans ~ often avoid the river when people are present. 132 has been a frequent user of Brooks River for many years, yet didn't attract much attention from bear watchers until she returned in fall of 2014 with 3 spring cubs in tow. 2005 is believed to be 132's year of birth. 132 was initially classified as a 4.5 year-old subadult in 2009. Ranger Jeanne's flickr album of 132 and her 3 spring cubs. Ranger Jeanne provided this helpful information when trying to determine the difference between the 132 family group and the 813 Nostril Bear family group since both sows had 3 spring cubs during the 2014 season.: \"132 has a darker, more uniformly colored muzzle than 813.

I am just back into Anchorage this afternoon and am on limited internet so not sure what is the latest update on the remaining cub and its mum. It was a tough evening to be there but still an honour to be witness to these tough lives. I did not see the interaction. I did see the two boars head out of the falls (I was on the Falls platform) and then headed back to the Riffles (to return to camp-I was unaware) to hear and see the tiny bear in the tree and the two NP workers monitoring the situation. We saw the little body but the boar (856) had moved on and the mother (132) was not nearby at that stage. We were/are very concerned about her condition. I will hopefully share some happier pictures of our amazing three night visit (arrival July 1, 2018 - departure July 4, 2018).\" Truman Everts shared aphotoof 132 on4/23/2020.In answer to a question as to the date of the photo, Truman later shared that it was a cropped photo of 132 and her 2 spring cubs on July 3, 2018, shortly before one cub was killed by 856.Truman Everts then shared this July 3 ~18:05 AKDT, 2018photoof 132 and her 2 spring cubs on4/24/2020.Approximately 90 minutes later, one of these cubs would perish at the hands of 856. Comment by Truman: \"Yeah. You know it's uncharacteristic for me not to date them...(I didn't this time, and cropped [judiciously?] to not complicate the ID,given the heartrending loss of one of these cubs, within 90 minutes).

Please request Truman Everts'permissionprior to using his photographs! On the evening of July 3, 2018 856 killed one of 132's (? ID not firm) spring cubs. OnJuly 4, 2018 at 06:20 Ranger Andrew popped into the bearcam comments to share the news of the July 3, 2018 incident: \"Hi everyone, last night near the Riffles we had a dramatic reminder that life as a bear can be difficult, dangerous, and short. Bear856came upon what is thought to be bear 132 and her two spring cubs. Bear 856 attacked and killed one of the cubs. After an altercation with 856, bear 132 then left the scene wounded. Herremaining cub was abandoned in a tree above the carcass of its deceased sibling. It could be heard vocalizing and crying out to its separated mother. The abandoned cub was later seen coming down from the tree, still vocalizing, and wandering around by itself. The whereabouts of both it and its mother are not known at this time. Though it can be tough to witness, infanticide is a natural part of the bear world. Both genders may kill cubs, it is most often committed by male bears. Mike Fitz and I will be doing a live chat later today on this topic at 9am Alaska time, 10am pacific. -Ranger Andrew\" Another thing we learned is that the Riffles platform was closed to park visitors on the evening of July 3, 2018 when the incident of 856 killing 132's cub took place. KNP&P's July 4, 2018 Facebook post shared this information about the July 3, 2018 infanticide incident between 856 and the 132 family group.: Their Facebook post included two photos (#1 of 132's deceased spring cub & #2 of 132's treed remaining spring cub after being separated from 132 ) courtesy of Ranger Russ Taylor. In reply to a comment on their Facebook post thread, KNP&P shared this additional information about the incident: \"The actual event was not caught on video [by the park service] or in front of the Bearcams. It is likely that it took place simply out of aggression. 856 was seen engaging with 634 Popeye shortly beforehand.\". KNP&P also shared this information about the 132's deceased cub's body: \"The body of the cub will be left in place, particularly because the location (below the Riffles platform) is closed to humans on the ground June 15 to August 15.\" KNP&P also replied to another social media user: \"Thanks for the thoughtful comment, Beatrice. This sort of event, although occasionally tragic from our perspective, is a regular and recurring part of their world.\" They also shared that this may just be a case of 132 and her 2 spring cubs being in the wrong place at the wrong time .: \"Yes, these are a few of the theories regarding infanticide. This particular instance just may have been an example of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Dominant bears in particular are likely conditioned to attack small, perceptibly weak creatures. And yes, 814 Lurch was seen killing a cub a number of years ago.\": KNP&P also shared this July 3, 2018 video of 132's remaining spring cub bawling up in the tree courtesy of Ranger Russ Taylor in the comment thread below the July 4, 2018 KNP&P Facebook post by Ranger Andrew.

On July 5, 2018 KNP&P commented an update in their July 4, 2018 Facebook post thread that 132 and her remaining spring cub had been reunited with a photo of them together. KNP&P also commented on July 5, 2018 in the same July 4, 2018 Facebook post thread re: 132's physical condition . \"...she (132) appears okay. She did seem to be walking a little stiffly, but hopefully will be back to 100% soon\".: 2018.07.04: There is hope that 132 and her remaining spring cub have been reunited, but there is no confirmation from rangers with boots on the ground at this time.

The cub was chased into the tree by the sub-adult bear. The sub-adult was fiercely pursuing this cub. The cub was scared, screaming for his life making all sorts of noise. The mother returned from fishing in the river to find her cub fighting for his life in the tree. The mother started shaking the tree to scare the sub-adult bear away, so the baby cub could finally return to the ground after three hours of being chased by this white bear. The mother bear wouldn\u2019t stand a repeat of what happened less than 10 days ago, when her other cub was killed by another boar (male bear). The mom and the cub proceed to leave the area following the river bank, where they ran into the sub-adult bear again.

Please request Truman Everts'permissionprior to using his photographs! 2019.07.??:  KNP volunteer Stacey shared a July 2019 story about 132 and her yearling.  \"Hi, everyone -- Happy 132 Day! I have a couple of long 132 stories -- but I think I haven't written them down yet! So here are a couple of quick memories: 1) In 2019, 132 had a LARGE yearling cub, unofficially nicknamed Cubzilla. (To my knowledge, I don't think we've had a confirmed sighting of this bear since his emancipation.) This yearling was VERY large -- in July 2019, as a yearling, he was almost as large as his mother. Longtime, knowledgeable bear viewers frequently mistook them for a pair of subadults, rather than a mother and cub. 2) I remember one morning in 2019, sitting on the LR viewing platforms watching 132 and yearling, and then seeing them disappear from view into the Lower River. For the next hour, I'd hear quiet -- and then loud growling; then quiet, then loud growling; then repeat. I believed (and still believe) that 132 was using the time to teach her yearling how to steal fish. (This is unconfirmed, but this is what it sounded like.) Also: Cubzilla can growl nearly as loudly as 480 O T I S. 3) One day, in July 2019, I was working in the Visitors Center. There were LOTS of visitors on this July day, and so we had a looooong line of people waiting to get into the mandatory bear orientation. With large crowds of waiting visitors, we frequently asked people to wait outside (since space inside is limited). So I was standing outside the Visitors Center, talking with the waiting visitors about bears. Suddenly, two bears came RUNNING into camp -- perhaps running from another bear, they'd zoomed unseen past the auditorium and into the area next two the Visitors Center. The two bears SCREECHED to a halt in front of the Visitors Center. They hit the brakes so suddenly that dust flew up. The two bears -- 132 and her very large cub -- found themselves right in the midst of the waiting visitors. 132 huffed, and the cub looked around, surprised. When this happens, protocol is to alert bear management (which I immediately did), and to ask the visitors to move up against the side of the buildings, creating a path for the bears to move through. The visitors quickly and quietly pressed against the sides of the VC, and on the other side of the path, against the side of the restroom. (A few moved inside he restroom!) Slowly, 132 and cub walked past the VC, and down to the beach. I kept wondering (and still wonder) what it must have been like for the two bears to find themselves suddenly surrounded by people. Thankfully, 132 and cub remained calm, and the visitors did, too. The rules worked like they're supposed to, and the encounter was very brief. So glad to have these memories of 132 and her 2019 yearling -- two very memorable bears.\" 2019.07.01: Truman Everts shared this 7/1/2019 photo of 132's yearling on 4/25/2020.

Her legs are typically darker than her back and face. 2015 - 2018Bears of Brooks River books:This bear has been seen using Brooks River every fall since 2009, but she only sporadically uses the river in July. She seems tolerant of people on wildlife viewing platforms, yet she appears to avoid people in other locations. #171 often avoids other bears and isn\u2019t tolerant of their approach. 171 was initially classified as a subadult in Fall of 2009. Subadult 171 was observed using the Brooks River in Fall of 2010.On October 7, 2017 Ranger Jeanne shared these three 2010 photos of 171 when she was a subadult.

While both cubs appeared small for spring cubs at the time of season they were first observed in 2014, one of 171's two spring cubs lighter and larger than the other, and the other spring cub was even smaller but muchdarker than their littermate.When 171was initially observed in July 2014, her identification was not immediately certain. There was a period of time when it was considered that she could possibly be 608 . After further research, comparison to prior season bear monitoring photos, and consultation with bear monitoring staff, her identification was determined to be 171, not 608.171 didn't attract much attention from bear watchers until she returned with cubs in 2014 even though 171 was a frequent user of the Brooks River for many prior years. 2014.07.15:171 with her two spring cubs video by Various Videos 1: 171 and 2 spring cubs 07 15 2014 video by Various Videos 1-0 2014.07.17: 171 with her two spring cubs on gravel bar near lagoon heading to closed trailgif by Juergen. 171 with her two spring cubs near closed trailgif by Juergen: 15:28: Ranger Mike observed 171 and her two spring cubs and shared these photos that he just took: Photo #1 and Photo #2: On the evening of July 17, 2018 171 and her 2spring cubs treed themselves near the grassy knoll in the lower river area video by JBGrace: 171 and 2 spring cubs treed near grassy point in lower river area 7 17 2014 (Alaska time) video by JB Grace 2014.07.18:171 and her 2 tiny spring cubs: 2014.07.19: Ranger Jeanne's photos of 171 with two spring cubs: Photo #1 , Photo #2 , Photo #3 , Photo #4 , Photo #5 , Photo #6 , Photo #7(171 only), Photo #8 , Photo #9 , and Photo #10 .

An idyllic time, the cub finds some little snacks to occupy it. The close-ups of the spring cub in the first 6 minutes of the video are a must see, but the action starts at about the 6 minute mark into the video. Suddenly, the cub is startled and runs back to shore. 171 turns back to check on the cub and panics when she cannot see the cub, hidden in the tall grass. 171 bounds across the water, soon finding the cub, but remains protectively wary of surrounding, seemingly ready to mete out punishment to whatever culprit scared her precious cub!...video by JBirdyHome: 171 with remaining spring cub (610?)

No one knows why this bear\u2019s cubdisappeared, but it is not uncommon for bear cubs to die from a myriad of circumstances. 171 was originally included in the 2015 Bears of Brooks River book on page 31. In 2015, no cubs remained from 171's 2014litter. However, in 2015 there was a small subadult, 610 , that strongly resembled 171's remaining 2014 larger, lighter spring cub.Some cam viewers speculate that 610 is the 2015 abandoned yearling of 171, and the 2015 bear monitoring records reflect that park staff also share in that speculation . 2015.07.11: A single adult female was observed in front of the Brooks Falls Wildlife Viewing Platform by cam viewers. She resembled 171 without her remaining yearling. Ranger Jeanne commented and shared that Ranger Mikethought this sow might be 171.

Unlike some other bears, #171 was not seen consistently throughout the summer or fall. Little is known about the movements of wild brown bears, and we see only a glimpse of their lives while they fish the Brooks River. Research projects like the Brown Bear Genetics Study and the Changing Tides Project aim to tell us more about the lives and movements of bears like #171. 2016.07.09: 12:2?: Mickey Williams captured this video of 171 and her 3 spring cubs (Part 1): 12;2? pm 07.09.2016 mom 171 with 3 COYs part 1 Katmai video by Mickey Williams 12:3?: Mickey Williams captured this video of 171 and her 3 spring cubs (Part 3): 12;3? pm 07.09.2016 mom 171 with 3 COYs part 3 Katmai video by Mickey Williams 12:4?: Mickey Williams captured this video of 171 and her 3 spring cubs (Part 4): 12;4? pm 07.09.2016 mom 171 with 3 COYs part 4 Katmai video by Mickey Williams Martina's snapshots of 171 with 3 spring cubs: Snapshot #1 andSnapshot #2 Martina also captured this video of the 171 family group: 2016 07 9 Sow & 3 spring cubs LR possibly 171 video by Martina Erum Chad (aka Erie) captured this video of the 171 family group: Sow 171 with 3 coys 2016-07-09 video by Erum Chad (aka Erie) Ratna captured this video of 171 and her 3 spring cubs: 171 and coys from rw July 9, 2016 video by Ratna Cam viewer and park visitor grandmaj captured 7/9/2016 photos that she shared in chat on 5/10/2020, #1 and #2.

Sow 171 treed her cubs outside of employee housing in Brooks Camp due to a sub-adult bear following her. This was in the evening and employees were coming home from work. I paused videoing for a minute to yell to people to go around the long way so as to avoid her, which they did, but she did go to investigate. After, she seemed much more calm not seeing the other bear, so she called her cubs back down and wandered off. Just a couple minutes later, though, the other bear walked by, following her again. It's a young bear and probably not much of a threat to her cubs, but a mother can never be too safe, which is why mother bears will tree their cubs fairly often, both to get them away from danger and also to wrangle them into a single spot so the mom can get some \"work done\" like fishing. You can hear 171 huffing and jaw popping in the video. The subadult appeared to be 901. 171 treeing spring cubs July 1, 2019 by Kara Stenberg-0 Truman Everts shared this 7/1/2019 photo of 171 and her 2 spring cubs near Naknek Lake on 4/15/2020.

BearTreeHugr's comments \"171 and her precious coy welcomed us to Brooks Camp on our trip in 2019 (sorry pics were taken through the plane windows). We had to wait in the plane until the family finally meandered far enough down the beach for us to start our day. The beach is basically a playground for cubs with an assortment of things to chew and play with! When it sadly came time to leave Brooks, we were gathered on the beach and 171 was on the far end, near the mouth of the river. The cubs had finally settled down for a nap when a float plane appeared and started approaching at the end of the beach near her. She wasn't happy \"Don't wake the sleeping babies!\". She didn't feel comfortable and decided to move back down the beach towards us. We had to quickly leave the beach area and wait for her to pass by. The rangers did an excellent job keeping everyone aware of them and trying to allow her to go where she wanted to go. She kept them on their toes! She suddenly decided to exit the beach and cut up into the camp area. When you visit Brooks, you must ALWAYS stay alert for bears and cued to the rangers for potential situations. The rangers put the bears FIRST! She seemed to be a very caring, attentive, and protective mamma bear. I was heart-broken when I learned earlier this year that neither cub had survived. They were the very first brown bear sow and cubs that I had personally met, ever, and I'll always hold a special fondness for 171. Their memories will always be bittersweet and the harsh realities of a cub's life learned.

She was charging Rangers in camp and the surviving cub was very scared and clinging underneath her. The discussion can be heard from 28:40-29:29. Note: Video unavailable as of 2021. Thumbnail left for context. 07.29.2019 - Sows and Cubs with Rangers Barbara and Naomi by Brenda D Discussions as to which spring cub 171 lost and which cub remains with her have evolved.: When a sow loses a cub, the discussion of which cub was lost comes up. Mazey compared fur color on 171's two spring cub's faces awhile ago. Mazey thought the large cub's was dark and the runt's was lighter brown, but couldn'tbe positive. Some might find it strange that individuals wonder which cub was lost. Observations over the years have shown that larger cubs will often wander further away from their motherwhile smaller cubs tend to remain in closer proximity to the safety of their mother. What we would like to learn from trying to determine which cub(s) of a litter are lost, is if larger cubs wandering at greater distance may play a role in larger cubs being lost and if smaller cubs are more likely to survive because they stay so close to their mother. Goldilocks Canada has participated in some of those overversations and shared this information on January 30, 2020 at 11:33 with supporting pics: #1 , #2 , #3 , #4 , #5 & #6 . Goldilocks added one more snapshot:: \"While reading this, was just reminded of our \u201cconversation\u201d as to which cub 171 lost. Both of us felt that it was the smaller cub. You posted a video of 171 and surviving cub on the Valley Road. Here is a screen grab of the surviving cub standing. As well as a pic I took of the smaller cub\u2019s natal collar. (Note the darker patch, in the collar, near the cub\u2019s left shoulder area in both pics.) I was sure that I had also gotten a pic of the larger cub\u2019s chest.....have searched for it to no avail.;))) I remember thinking that there were clear differences in the chest pattern.....though it was quite similar.I came across this collage that Martina did in my photos the other day (I have enlarged one of the pics in the collage). It clearly shows that the larger cub had a patch of white near the nape of it\u2019s neck. The smaller cub had no white in that area.Here are some screen grabs I took of the surviving cub, from slightly different angles, on July 23/19. I see no evidence of a white patch in that area.Some might say, \u201cwhy does it matter?\u201d. In the time of the cams, I believe I have observed that the majority of cubs that are lost are not the smallest ones (the ones we often perceive to be the weakest, most vulnerable ones). \u201cIF\u201d my observations are correct what are the possible reasons.....Do the bigger cubs take more risks? Are they more likely to leave a larger distance between themselves and their protective mothers? ....etc....etc?\" Mazey replied on February 1, 2020 06:32: \"...That is a great pick up re: the dark spot on the shoulder of the cub. I also think that the X on the chest would really tell us which cub was lost. I have done a quick look through my bookmarks to see if the larger cub has the same X natal collar on its chest and have not found any photos. I will try to find some photos on Monday. Here are a few to look through although it mostly confirms the X collar on the smaller cub.born2flyalaska Instagram (he had lots of interactions with 171 and cubs on the beach): Devon Holmberg(aka born2flyalaska) videos of 171 with 2 spring cubs: #1 , #2 , #3 & #4 RV Dreams has tons of July 18, 2019 photographs: Page 3 , Page 4 , Page 5 & Page 6...\" KCanada & Goldilocks Canada continue the discussion \u200b\u200b2019.07.21:Dennis Harmon captured 171 and her remaining spring cub in this video on July 21, 2019. Mr Harmon confirmed that this video was filmed on 7/21/2019. The cub's face appears to be light brown.: Too close for comfort 171 with her remaining spring cub July 21, 2019 by Dennis Harmon Cam viewer and NPS volunteer Stacey shared her story of observing 171 on 7/21/2019 with only 1 spring cub. Part 1: Here's Part One of my 171 story. It's kind of background. The adventure is in Part 2, which I'll post shortly. Bear 171 in 2019, Part 1:In July 2019, Bear 171 and her two spring cubs were ubiquitous at Brooks Camp. The light-colored mom and her two tiny cubs of the year were first spotted at Brooks Camp in late June, and in the first part of July, the family group was a central and well photographed presence in camp\u2014that is, the human-populated area around Brooks Lodge, the Visitor Center and the Ranger Station. 171 would nurse her cubs on the beach in front of the Visitor Center\u2014welcoming arriving guests, and creating a bear jam that forced them to walk down the beach and take an alternate route to their mandatory, first-thing-when-you-arrive bear orientation. The cubs learned to climb the flagpole in front of the VC, delighting departing guests who were waiting to catch their afternoon flights. For several consecutive days in July, a persistent and curious subadult followed the family group through camp, causing 171 to tree her cubs outside the lodge (or outside the yurt, or outside the ranger station) while she waited patiently below for the subadult to leave. Even after a few days, once the subadult had moved on to other adventures, she treed her cubs, more than once, just outside the Visitor Center, causing rangers to strategize alternate visitor routes and escorts between the VC, the food cache, the lodge and the plane landing/loading area on Naknek Beach. As a mother bear, there are lots of things to worry about: Bigger bears, sometimes-unpredictable humans and so much more. When 171 was worried about one of those perceived threats, she\u2019d send them up a tree. At Brooks Camp, it\u2019s not unusual for mother bears to use human groups as protection for their cubs. Moms will often nurse their cubs near Brooks Lodge overnight. We\u2019ve seen 128 Grazer, 402 and other moms \u201cpark\u201d their cubs next to the viewing platforms while they fish; the logic seems to be that the since big male bears tend to avoid the viewing platforms\u2014and other areas with humans\u2014those areas may be a safe place for moms to leave cubs while they fish and gain the calories necessary to keep themselves and their cubs fed. But 171\u2019s behavior in July 2019 seemed somewhat different (to me, anyway). In the first part of July, anecdotally, she seemed to be seen in the human-populated areas of camp more often than other bears. And her safety procedure was clearly to send her cubs up a tree. A knowledgeable volunteer described 171\u2019s behavior during that period as \u201cindecisive\u201d; he worried that 171 was so focused on protecting her cubs that she wasn\u2019t getting the calories she\u2019d need to help the cubs succeed. (To be fair, July 2019 was incredibly warm\u2014with air temperatures in the 80s and 90s, and water temperatures in the low 70s\u2014so there was a long stretch in early July when the Brooks River salmon run was much lower than normal. It may be that 171\u2019s presence in camp was a reflection of the fact that there just weren\u2019t a lot of salmon to be had in the river.) Part 2: Here's Part 2 of my 171 story. I call it: Mom with Single Cub on the Trail Sunday, July 21, was a day off for me. I\u2019d spent time at volunteer housing, cleaning and doing laundry, then headed down to the river to watch and talk w/people about bears. I made a quick stop at the Brooks Falls platform, to pick up a water bottle that I\u2019d forgotten there the night before. Water bottle in hand, I joined several guests who were leaving the platform and heading toward camp. It was just before 10:45 a.m. We chatted as we walked down the Brooks Falls Trail, away from the viewing platforms. And then, when we were about two-thirds of the way down the trail, heading toward the pit toilets, we spotted a light blond bear, spring cub at her heels, approaching us on the path. She was walking briskly and determinedly, so our group moved quickly off the trail to let the family group pass. As we stood together in the forest, about 8 feet off the trail, the family group walked toward us on the trail. And then, right in front of us, they stopped. This, for me, was unusual. Usually when you encounter a bear on the trail, you step aside, the bear walks past, and everyone goes about their business. Sometimes, an inquisitive subadult will try to follow you into the woods\u2014though they usually move on once they hear human voices. But I\u2019d never had a bear stop right in front of me on the trail before. I immediately noticed something else unusual: This bear had only one spring cub. \u201cThis surprises me,\u201d I said to the guests who were with me in the woods. \u201cI\u2019m not sure which bear this is: I think it's Bear 171, but it might be Bear 719, or it might be the unidentified mom who was reported in camp early in the season. All of those bears are light colored like this one\u2014but all of those bears have two spring cubs. \u201cSo unless this is a new bear who\u2019s just arrived with one spring cub, I\u2019m concerned that this might be a mom who's missing a cub.\u201d Often, when you\u2019re with a group of people off trail, waiting for a bear to go past, there\u2019s a lot of chatter. People are filming and taking photos, of course, but we\u2019re also following the instructions from bear school\u2014you\u2019re talking so that the bear hears your voice and moves past. Usually, it\u2019s \u201cHey, bear.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s okay, bear.\u201d \u201cKeep on walking, bear.\u201d \u201cThank you, bear.\u201d But in this case, my group was very quiet. The bear was stopped on the trail, looking back the way she came. Her tiny cub stood close to her legs. I talked, kind of narrating what I was seeing, and the group listened, taking photos and filming video. It seemed like we were all holding our breath, waiting for the second cub to arrive. But the second cub never came. I observed at the time that the mother bear didn\u2019t seem agitated; she was sniffing the air occasionally, but she wasn\u2019t huffing and she didn\u2019t seem frantic. She was watching the trail behind her\u2014it seemed that she might have been waiting for the cub, or maybe she was watching out for another bear? She seemed quite comfortable with our presence; she wasn\u2019t in a hurry to move away. After a few minutes, the mom and cub turned back down the trail the way they\u2019d came. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait here,\u201d I said, to my group in the woods. \u201cWe want to give her lots of extra space in case she\u2019s looking for her cub.\u201d The mom and cub walked a few feet down the trail, toward the toilets, never leaving our view. Then they stopped again, and then they returned to their first waiting spot in front of us. The mom still seemed unperturbed. Our group stayed in the woods, watching and talking quietly about what we were seeing. After about five minutes, the two bears moved up the trail, heading toward Brooks Falls. Usually, once a bear moves past, the people waiting want to move out of the woods right away. But in this case, \u201cLet\u2019s just wait here for a while,\u201d I said. \u201cI want to see if that other cub comes along.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d someone said softly from the trees behind me. \u201cWe have time.\u201d (The patience and kindness in his voice made me want to cry.) We waited another six or eight minutes, with no signs of bears. And then we moved out onto the trail. As our group walked down the Falls Trail, heading away from the viewing platforms and toward camp, we talked quietly and kept our eyes open for bears. I\u2019ll admit that I was especially looking in the trees. We saw no other bears, and we saw no people, until we reached the Lower River platforms. I notified the bear management rangers that I\u2019d seen a mom with a single spring cub, and that I thought it was 171. (\u201cOh, that\u2019s interesting,\u201d was the immediate response.) And later in the day, I started hearing reports that 171 had been spotted with one spring cub. There were no reports of lone cubs. GreenRiver posted below that \u201cWhen one of our sows looses a coy, instead of thinking the little one has died, I prefer to imagine that somewhere out there is another \u201ccubadult\u201d that we will never know about. Another coy or yearling whose amazing story will never be known or celebrated by us, but who is out there anyway, perhaps with an even more incredible story than our known 503 and 610.\u201d That\u2019s how I\u2019ll choose to think about 171\u2019s missing coy. And as 2019 went on, I was repeatedly struck by the audacity and boldness of 171\u2019s surviving cub. Who knows how his story has changed by the loss of his sibling? So here\u2019s to 171: A mom who tries. A mom who raised a bold and tenacious cub through the summer of 2019. And a mom who taught me -- and many visitors -- many lessons this past July. 2019.07.23: The next time 171 was observed on the cams was on 7/23/2019 and she only had 1 cub.

The bears liked the weather too as many of them were out and about, including some momma bears with their cubs. There were several awe-inspiring moments that day and one of my favorites happened that evening when 171 and her cub came across 708 Amelia and her coys on the closed trail. 171's lone cub and 708's light cub traded cute little bluff charges back and forth, to the amusement of all of us on the bridge lookout.

One of the spring cubs was larger and had a lighter coat. The other spring cub was noticeably smaller and much darker. One of these offspring is now believed to be female bear 610. 171 lost the darker, smaller spring cub during the 2014 season (see August 2014 in the Life History Section above). A small, dark abandoned spring cub was observed for a period of time shortly after 171 was observed with only the larger, lighter remaining spring cub. Deanna Dittloff (aka deelynnd) created this video of 610 that begins when she was a spring cub with 171 (speculated). Footage of 171 with her believed offspring, 610 can be seen in the beginning of this video.: 2015:Single Female (see 2015 Subadult 610) When initially observed in the 2015 season, 171 was asingle adult female with no remaining yearlings from her 2014 litter.However, in 2015 there was a small subadult, 610 , that strongly resembled 171's remaining 2014 larger, lighter spring cub.Some cam viewers speculate that 610 is the 2015 abandoned yearling of 171, and the 2015 bear monitoring records reflect that park staff also share in that speculation . 2016:3Spring Cubs, 2nd Known Litter 171 returned to the Brooks River with 3 spring cubs, her 2nd known litter. 2017:3Yearlings, Lost 1, 2 RemainingYearlings 171 initially returned to the Brooks River with all three yearlings from her 2016 litter, but was soon after seen with only two remaining yearlings. Both of these remaining yearlings were very small, and often treed themselves in the presence of other bears. 2019:2 Spring Cubs 171 returned with 2 spring cubs, her 3rd known litter. Sometime around July 20, 2019 and July 21, 2019 , 171 lost one of her two spring cubs. Rangers did not witness the circumstances that lead to 171 losing this offspring, but they do discuss it in this July 29, 2019 live chat.Rangers said she had a personality change after that. She was charging Rangers in camp and the surviving cub was very scared and clinging underneath her.One of 171's spring cubs is/was a male. It is not known which of the two spring cubs 171 lost, so the sex of the remaining cub is not known. 2020: Single Female.171 lost her remaining spring cub between thefall of 2019 and the spring of 2020. 171 family tree - updated Nov 2022 Offspring: 610?: Speculated Some cam viewers speculate that 610 is the 2015 abandoned yearling of 171. and bear monitoring records reflect that park staff also share in the speculation .When last observed in 2014, 171 was observed with a remaining spring cub. When first observed in 2015, 171 was a single female. Around the same time a young, small subadult was observed; that subadult having a strong resemblance to 171's 2014 remaining spring cub. This cub would have been a yearling in 2015 and the size of the subadult also seems to support the possibility that 610 could be this remaining 171 2014 offspring.

Having no known litters and fishing primarily in the cut bank area, this bear often goes unnoticed by bear viewers.In 2016, 261 arrived at Brooks River for the first time in early July. We cannot know the motive for her change in behavior, but her ability to be flexible and modify her seasonal movements is one example of why brown bears are such a successful species.261 fished all areas of Brooks River during summer and fall, using mostly the \u201cdash and grab\u201d technique. She was occasionally seen playing with 503 Cubadult. 261 is the offspring of477 Sara , born in 2008. 261 had two litter mates, 251 and253. 261 was a spring cub part of 477 Sara's litter that included 251 and 253. 261 was a yearling remaining with 477 Sara along with 251 and 253.

It is always such a treat to see her--in all my trips to Brooks, I think I have only seen her in person twice. One year in September, we saw a very large bear in the distance on the beach.

Her ears are large and round. She has a furry face with closely set eyes. 2015 Bears of Brooks River book (Adult females section): 273 is medium-sized female with a blonde, shaggy coat. Her ears are large and round. She has a furry face with closely set eyes and dark eye rings. 2016 & 2017 Bears of Brooks River books: 273 is medium-sized female with a blonde, shaggy coat and darker legs. Her ears are large and round. She has a furry face and a large \u201cgoatee\u201d in the summer. Her eyes are closely set with dark eye rings. In the fall, her coat is dark blonde. 2014 & 2015 Bears of Brooks River books: Based on physical appearance and behavioral traits it\u2019s believed, but not proven, that this is the same bear formerly known as 198. Both 198 and 273 frequent the lower river, using the same areas to rest or slowly patrol back and forth for salmon. Unlike 198, 273 shows little curiosity towards human buildings or gear. While 198 repeatedly investigated and damaged objects around Brooks Camp in 2010, 273 has demonstrated disinterest in people\u2019s belongings. It is also quite possible 198 simply outgrew her curiosity towards humans and our objects. In 2014, 273was often seen fishing downstream of Brooks Falls near the island and she also attempted to fish the lip of the falls with no success. She has not been identified in the fall (see 2016 & 2017 Bears of Brooks River books, it is now believed that 273 was observed in the fall, but misidentified as bear 256). 2016 & 2017 Bears of Brooks River books: n July, 273often fishes downstream of Brooks Falls near the island and in the riffles. 273 also frequently fishes in the lower Brooks River. For several years, 273 seemed to show little curiosity towards human buildings or gear, but that changed in 2015 when she damaged several structures at Brooks Camp. Bears are curious creatures that often investigate strange and novel objects. Human habituated bears, like 273, are more likely to find and explore human buildings and equipment, often damaging them in the process. Brooks Camp\u2019s location\u2014in habitat that attracts and harbors bears\u2014creates a high likelihood for conflict between people and bears. While 273\u2019s behavior was unwelcome, she was simply expressing her curiosity and playfulness. Special regulations apply to Brooks River to help reduce the risk of bear and human conflicts. It is not possible or appropriate to manage the curiosity out of bears, but we can alter our behavior to reduce the chances that bears will express their curiosity on human property. When you visit Brooks Camp, be sure to give bears adequate space and do not leave anything unattended. (Previous versions of this book noted that this bear was not seen in the fall, but bear monitoring staff now believe she was misidentified in the fall as 256.) Other distinctive behavior observations: 273 has been observed diving for fish in both the lower Brooks River and in Naknek Lake. It is now believed that 273repeatedly investigated and damaged objects around Brooks Camp in 2010, but was misidentified as bear 198 at the time. 273 was included as a subadult female in the 2012 Brown Bears of Brooks Camp iBook: 2012.09.12: 273 in lower river area from lower river cam, identified by Ranger Jeanne: 2013.07.15: Could this be 273 in this video by eiguoc?

Park visitor and cam viewer, dcmorris01,was on the lower river platform when this took place and shared the following: \"I was there that day. I was on the platform killing some time before my plane left when it happened. She (273) just came up to the gate, hit it with her paw, and it opened. She then decided to try and remove some of the fence.\" Someone from Magical Adventures was also on the lower river platform that day and shared the following information: \"What a sight this was. We were on the platform across from the bridge and one of the bears went to the gate, jumped on it, shook it and it opened. The bear decided to take a stroll on the bridge. Now we know why the rangers do such a great job and tell us to walk quickly!\" Magical Adventures captured this video of 273's exploration of the floating bridge that day in 2014: Bear (273) opens gate and walks on Brooks Lodge Bridge 2014 video by Magical Adventures Park visitor Hermosa Paul captured this video of 273 (198) and 410: Bear Fight by Hermosa Paul (2014 410 & 273) HermosaPaul also captured this video of 273 fishing in the riffles.

Ranger Mike helps with identifying her and other information ~ 273 will be in the adult females section of the 2015 Bears of Brooks River book. She is a smaller adult female that tends to stand her ground nearother adult females.: 273 was included in the adult females section of the 2015 Bears of Brooks River book on page 34. For several years, #273 seemed to show little curiosity towards human buildings or gear, but that changed in 2015 when she damaged several structures at Brooks Camp.

Cam viewer, Pirate Autumn captured this snapshot and created a painting from it: 2015.08.11: Ranger Mike shares information about 273 and announces that the bear that was believed to possibly be 39 with a single spring cub is now believed to be 273 per Ranger Leslie Skora: \"Last week, the bear with the single spring cub who is often seen on the cam damaged several buildings, including an occupied ranger cabin. The bear is not 39 (like I suspected, but was never 100% sure of). According to Leslie Skora, Katmai's bear monitor, she is probably 273. 273 (page 34 in the bear ID book) has likely damaged property in the past. Bears have good memories. Even Experiences they have as cubs can stick in their minds through adulthood. In order to prevent more property damage, we have decided to escalate our attempts to haze the bear away from buidlings. Through increased staff presence and firmer, but still relatively low level hazing techniques (like air horns and other noise makers). I believe we can adequately deter this bear from damaging any more buildings. 273 has damaged the bridge, and if she continues to do that, then rangers will attempt to haze her away from the bridge is she damages it. Of course, the situation is complicated because 273 has a spring cub and we are concerned for its welfare too. We also have to be careful when hazing is applied near the bridge. The river is where bears find food. Therefore, hazing must be applied selectively in order to send the correct message (stop messing with the bridge) and not drive the family away from the river. Hazing is most effective when it is done in conjunction with specific place or bear behavior (like damaging a building or bridge). We will only haze her if she is damaging property or other buildings. You might see two rangers carrying shotguns this week. One shotgun is loaded with a non-lethal round like bean bags (which are designed to bruise and sting, but not permanently hurt the bear). Policy (and bear behavior) does require a second person carry a shotgun with lethal rounds in it whenever other deterrent rounds are used. We ought not need these weapons except in extreme circumstances, but they will be carried. If you want to read more about how bears are managed at Katmai, especially in regard to hazing, please read Katmai's bear management plan:The responsive management section beginning on page 21 is maybe most relevant to this situation . Overall, it is far easier and safer to prevent these incidents than it is to haze bears. That's why prevention is emphasized so heavily at Brooks Camp. However, the location of Brooks Camp invites bear-human conflicts. Rangers can't patrol the area 24/7. (Just yesterday, I erected a hastily installed electric fence around a building that 273 had damaged and entered.) Anytime, we deal with conflicts at this level, I worry. I worry for bears and for the people who deal with these situations, but as long as building remain where they are, bears and people will clash here on some level.\" 273 and the floating bridge gate video by Juanita Roper: Velcro's mama tries to break the gate down August 11, 2015 video by Juanita Roper 273 and the floating bridge gate video by JoeBear.: (note: 273 was initially mis-identified as 39) 273 Attacks Brooks Camp Bridge August 11, 2015 by JoeBear 273 in a tree near wader sign video by Martina: 8-11-2015 273 in a tree near wader sign video by Martina 2015.08.12 - 2015.08.18:Ranger Mike provides updates the NPS staff's efforts to manage the 273 family group: 2015.08.12: Ranger Mike's update on the 273 family group: \"273 avoided the camp area, so no action from rangers was necessary yesterday (August 11, 2015).\" Juergen gifs of 273 family group from early morning August 12, 2015 (before 08:30): Gif #1 & Gif #2. 273's spring cub climbs a tree near the grassy knoll approximately 11:51video by JoeBear: Velcro Up a Tree 273's spring cub August 12, 2015 video by JoeBear-0 2015.08.13: Ranger Mike's update on the 273 family group: \"273 approached the buildings once or twice, but rangers did not have to haze her.

Assertive body language and noise have been the only hazing techniques required when she has approached buildings. Of course, staff and visitors need to remain vigilant and exercise caution in bear country, but if we remove temptation from bears, then they are much less likely to cause property damage and park staff are less likely to have to resort to hazing the animals.

When the bears show up near the bridge, a \"bear jam\" is created, halting all foot traffic across the bridge (coming and going), sometimes for hours. That's when the \"bear techs\" are called in (park rangers specially trained to haze bears) to try to clear the area so the camp residents can get to/from camp.After the bear tech hazed this female and cub away from the bridge (about 50 yards away), foot traffic was allowed to resume across the bridge, after only a 20 minute delay. Shortly thereafter, however, the bears returned to the area and refused to leave, leaving dozens of camp residents stranded on either side of the bridge for almost three hours that afternoon.\" Brooks Camp - Bear \"Jam\" by Glenn LeMay 2016 (273 & 809) 2016.07.12:273 with her yearling 809 fishing the rifflesphoto by Anna-Marie_AZ: Please request Anna-Marie's permission prior to using her photograph! 2016.07.15: 273 and her yearling (809) at the falls in the early morning video by Erum Chad (aka Erie): 273 & Velcro - Falls adventure Early morning 2016-07-15 by Erum Chad (aka Erie) Cam viewer KCanada shared this snapshot of 273 with her yearling 809.: 2016.07.16: Truman Everts captured these photographs of 273 with her yearling (809); \"How to Snorkle\" (p 09/02/16 16:25).

Mckate explains what happened: \"This shows both the River Watch and Lower River views of the fight. This is long, so please bear with me. 273 and 806 are having what looks to be a mostly friendly conversation. Then 806 goes into the river to do some fishing while her cub eats on the bank on the right. 273 and her cubs are to the left. At one point you can see 806 call back to her cub to let it know where she is and the cub looks up, but promptly forgets because its so engrossed in eating its fish. So 806 drifts down about as far as the cam and then circles back up to her cub. As she walks up the bank, the cub becomes increasingly panicked because it doesn't realize that this is mom. It eventually jumps into the water and swims right towards the 273s! 806 chases after her cub and 273 seems to misinterpret what's happening and also swims right towards the distressed cub! It looks like 806 just about has her cub rounded up when it decides to climb on her back. 806, maybe thinking that it's 273 on her back, panics and rolls. 273, maybe thinking that 806 is biting the cub, then bites 806 and the fight ensues. A lot of speculation here, I know. 273 looks a little shell-shocked in the aftermath, but is otherwise okay. 806 and her cub are seen about 10 minutes later walking through the long grass and also seem to be okay.\" 10 Oct 2020 Cub's Panic Leads to Mom Fight, video by mckate 10/10/2020 video by Lani H. 806 and 273 have a kerfuffle 10 10 2020, video by Lani H FormerBear broke down the 10/10/2020 events in this very detailed video that explains what happened frame by frame.

Video by Gusty Stambaugh: Bear cubs are a handful. 402 with her spring cubs July 2013 video by Gusty Stambaugh On July 17, 2013 Ranger Mike Fitz was able to watch the video footage of 402's spring cubs going over the falls and shared the following comment: \"I just got a chance to watch the video of 402\u2019s cubs getting swept over the falls. These cams really give great insight into the dramas of nature. 402 will regularly fish the lip of the falls, even when she is caring for cubs. She is unconsciously weighing the risks of fishing at Brooks Falls versus the reward of food. There may be many other places along Brooks River to fish, but at this time of year none are typically as rewarding as Brooks Falls. As many of you know, cubs do face many risks in their young lives. In the video, the cubs are swept over the falls as they attempt to follow their mother into the river. Spring cubs (also called cubs of the year) cannot swim nearly as well as an adult bear. The current was too strong for them and they were swept over. One bear standing below the falls noticeably reacts to the cubs in the water. Just before the cubs were swept over, the bear was facing away from them. It appears that the other bear reacted to the objects washing over the falls. Bears are adapted to take advantage of situations where food is provided to them. If, for example, a beaver had washed over the falls then the bear might also have attacked it. All of the bears at the falls were once small cubs like 402\u2019s current litter and they all faced the same risks. 402\u2019s protectiveness may have saved one or more of her offspring last night. When you are watching nature\u2019s drama unfold at the falls, be prepared to witness some harsh realities.\" 2013.07.19:Juergen created these gifs of 402 and her spring cubs: Gif #1 & Gif #2 2013.07.20: 402 with her 3 spring cubs (503 Cubadult is one of them) video by MsDebbiB.: A Momma Bear with Three Little Cubs July 20, 2013 by MsDebbiB (402 503) 2013.07.21:402 is seen with 1 of her 3 spring cubs in this 7/21/2013 photo by Andrew Hall.

NPS photo by Mike Fitz July 1, 2014 \"July 1, 2014 was a stressful day for rangers and one yearling cub at Brooks Camp. Around 10 AM bear #402 became separated from her cub near the mouth of the Brooks River. The yearling walked and ran to Brooks Lodge and climbed a tree just outside of the lodge. The cub was not reunited with its mother until 8:15 PM. Several rangers and I had the fortune (or misfortune after several hours) of watching the cub in the tree. The cub was so close to the buildings at Brooks Lodge that people could not use the lodge bathhouse or access several cabins. The cub was less than 50 yards from the back door of the lodge kitchen and dining hall. What happened? Where was the cub\u2019s mother? Bear 402 and her yearling cub were at the mouth of the Brooks River fishing around 10 AM. The yearling cub swam across the river as 402 fished downstream. 402 lost track of the cub and did not know where it was. The cub didn\u2019t seem to know where its mother was either. 402 began searching for the cub on the opposite side of the river. Shortly after the family was separated, 402 disappeared into the forest at the mouth of the Brooks River. By this time, the yearling cub had wandering to Brooks Lodge and climbed a tree. With 402 nowhere in sight and her cub treed in camp, rangers were in a bit of jam. Contrary to popular belief brown bears can climb trees. I have seen cubs and adult bears do it. Brown bears are not likely to climb trees when threatened, but they can and sometimes do. When a bear climbs a tree, it won\u2019t climb down until it no longer feels threatened. With a few hundred people moving by Brooks Lodge, the cub was likely not coming down anytime soon. Bears have climbed trees at Brooks Lodge before, but those situations are usually short in duration. Typically, rangers have to keep people away from the bear and it will climb down and depart in short order. Having a lone cub treed in camp with no mother to be found was unprecedented. Our initial hope was that 402 would catch the cub\u2019s scent and track it into camp. Mother bears will call their cubs down out of trees with a huff. This time, 402 was missing in action. The cub was very high in the tree. We knew it was stressed. There is no way to get it out of the tree. It had to come down on its own. However, people still want to walk around the lodge and they still want to eat lunch. Brooks Lodge staff still has to meet airplanes on the beach only 100 yards (91 m) away and move luggage to the lodge with a vehicle less than 50 yards (46 m) from the treed cub. Unfortunately, it was not feasible to shut the camp down for the cub. All the noise and people likely kept the cub in the tree\u2014for hours. Around 5:30 PM, the cub decided to climb down the tree. Rangers instructed people to enter buildings, stay out of the cub\u2019s line of sight, and give it space to go on it\u2019s way. Any noise could startle the cub and cause it climb to the tree again. Spreading that message is hard though. As the cub got to the base of the tree, a plane started its engine and spooked the cub. It climbed back up the tree and stayed there. Remember, the cub climbed the tree around 10 AM. Around 6 PM, the cub climbed down the tree again. This time it was not startled by people or engines and left the lodge area on it\u2019s own. Its mother was still nowhere to be found. The cub walked along the beach away from the lodge and toward the campground. Perhaps uncomfortable without its mother, it soon returned to the lodge and climbed a tree. I felt sympathy for the cub, but I was frustrated by the situation.There was essentially nothing we could do to coax the cub down and away from the buildings. This was clearly a place where it felt some comfort and safety. Otherwise it would not have returned. We couldn\u2019t do anything more than watch and wait. People walking by Brooks Lodge could easily see the yearling cub in the tree (yellow circle). July 1, 2014 NPS photo by Mike Fitz Finally around 8 PM, the cub came out of the tree. 402 whereabouts were still unknown. Several rangers worked hard to keep people inside of buildings. No planes were on the beach and the cub had free reign. Still, it was alone. It wanted its mother. It tried to return to the lodge, but eventually left that area and walked back to the river. Shortly after it reached the river it began to bawl. Cubs bawl when they are hungry or otherwise trying to get mother\u2019s attention. This was something it rarely did in the tree. The bawling clearly got the attention of one bear that swam across the river towards it. When I heard that another bear was approaching the cub, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. The other bear could ignore it, kill it, or scare it back to the lodge. To my amazement, the bear that was approaching the cub was 402, his mother. She must have been near the mouth of the river and heard the cub\u2019s bawling. After 10 hours of separation, they were finally back together. The family was last seen moving upriver into the forest. 402 reunited with her yearling cub at Brooks River, not far from Brooks Lodge July 1, 2014 Explore Live Cam snapshot This was a happy ending for the family, but it highlights the challenges of managing people and bears at Brooks Camp. The facilities at Brooks Camp\u2014lodge, employee housing, and visitor center\u2014are located in perfect bear habitat. It is difficult to reconcile the different needs of people and bears. The situation may have resolved itself sooner if we were not around. At minimum, the bear would have been able to move freely without our interference. But, Brooks Camp is a place for people too. A cub in a tree near the lodge is not a simple matter to deal with and the camp can\u2019t shut down for the sake of the cub. When you watch the bearcams or visit Katmai, think about our relationship with the animals as well as how a park should be used and managed. Parks are for people and well as wildlife and ecosystems. For generations, people have been debating how to balance the needs of people and animals. In a place like Brooks Camp, the needs of people and wildlife are bared for all to see. How do you provide for the needs of people at a place like Brooks Camp and give bears the space they need to survive?\" 19:55: Watch 402 and her yearling cub being reuntied on the bank of Brooks River in this Explore Documentary Film.

The yearling was still in the tree at 21:00 on 07/10/2014(see Ranger Mike;s 07/11/2014 12:28 comments snips below). When Ranger Mike walked by the area of the tree around 22:00 on 07/10/2014, he did hear the cub bawling a little. 2014.07.11: On the morning of 07/11/2014, 402's remaining male yearling (503) was no longer in the tree 100 meters behind the Brooks Falls wildlife viewing platform. 856 is still following 402 and the whereabouts of 402's remaining male yearling is not known. Ranger Mike Fitz comments on 07/11/2014 at 12:28 about what has been observed of 402, her remaining male yearling (503), and 856 from 07/09/2014 - 07/11/2014: Ranger Mike also shared this 07/11/2014 KNP&P blog:Surprises of the Bear World. 2014.07.13: Ranger Jeanne comments that she has no new information on 402's remaining yearling (503), but she has observed 402 twice this morning being pursued by 856. Ranger Jeanne said that 402 is ranging about half mile down river from the falls since she observed 856 pursuing 402 in the oxbow area. When asked if in her experience she would say that 402's remaining yearling was on his own to survive, Ranger Jeanne replied that she has never seen a sow without one of her cubs for such a long period of time and then experienced them reuniting. Ranger Jeanne said she has also never observed a male bear pursue a female in the way that resembles courting while she still had a dependent cub. She said she observed 402 quite a bit this weekend, but never with her cub. She said it does not necessarily mean that the cub is definitely on its own, but Ranger Jeanne did not personally see them together. 2014.07.14:  Ranger Mike updates theSurprises of the Bear WorldKNP&P blog from 07/11/2014. \"856 was still following 402 on Sunday (07/13/2014). Reports of 856 following a different female may have been erroneous. I watched 402\u2019s former yearling cub wander through Brooks Camp alone at 8 AM this morning. A ranger also reported seeing it alone on Saturday morning (07/12/2014). 402 appears to have abandoned this cub. Why? I don\u2019t know. Bears might abandon their cubs if the cubs are too weak to keep up or if the mother can\u2019t devote the energy needed to support the cubs. I also don\u2019t know if this cub is truly abandoned. Although very rare, mother bears have been separated from their cubs for over 2 weeks before reuniting. We haven\u2019t observed 402 abandon a cub before, but this behavior is not unprecedented amongst brown bears. It\u2019s also important to note that 856 showed no interest in the yearling during the past week. His actions indicate that he is interested in mating with 402. He was never seen chasing the yearling or even investigating the yearling when it was treed near Brooks Falls. His consistent pursuit of 402 certainly didn\u2019t help the yearling, but he may not have been the reason for its abandonment. 402 may have gone into estrus and abandoned the yearling anyway. Is 402 a \u201cbad\u201d mother for abandoning her yearling? It would seem so from a human perspective, but we cannot define or label bears with our system of cultural norms, ethics, and morals. Bears and wild animals exist in a world outside of these things. 402 doesn\u2019t have the ability to control her estrus cycle, no more so than a woman can. If she went back into estrus (which appears likely now), then 856 or any other adult male would be looking to mate with her. She would be unable to care for a cub while being closely pursued by a dominant adult male. 402\u2019s former yearling cub should now be called a subadult bear since it is now appears to be on its own.It faces an uphill battle to survive this summer.\" 2014.07.16 Approximately 16:00: Ranger Sheri Anderson, KNP&P Wildlife Biologist observes 503 eating a fish on the trail to the campground that he caught himself and captured this photo: You can see Ranger Roy show the photo from Ranger Sheri's phone at approximately 38:00 into this live chatvideofrom 07/16/2014: Part 1 of 2 Ranger Roy and Ranger Mike test the mic's and chat July 16, 2014, video by MsDebbiB 2014.07.17: 435 Holly and her spring cub (719) were observed on the lower river cam alone (503 was not with them at this time), gif by Juergen can be viewedhere. 2014.07.18: 503, now an independent subadult bear, is treed near Brooks Lodge again.Ranger Mike goes livefrom near Brooks Lodge where 503 is treed.Videoby Various Videos1 (aka LucyB-MA): Treed abandoned bear (402's cub), video by Various Videos1 (aka LucyB-MA) 2014.07.20 (Sunday):  402 and 856 were observed mating per Ranger Mike's 07/22/2014 comment: \"Last night (07/21/2014) Ranger Jeanne hinted that I had some news to share. I\u2019d like to watch the speculation run wild, but you don\u2019t need to be on the edge any longer than necessary. First of all, it is not about 489 Ted. We still haven\u2019t seen him. The news that I have isn\u2019t that earth shattering. In fact, for those of you following the bears closely over the past two weeks, it might be an expected event. Last Sunday (07/20/2014), 856 and 402 mated near Brooks Falls. This confirms what many of us suspected \u2013 that 402 was in estrus. Like I\u2019d written about previously, this is odd because she still had a yearling cub to attend to until it was left to fend for itself around July 9. Bears are full of surprises though. I would be even more surprised if 402 reunites with her former cub, now a 1.5-year-old subadult bear, since she has mated. For now, I\u2019m going to assume she\u2019ll follow the \u201ctypical\u201d pattern for a single adult female and go her own way. The 1.5-year-old will have to fend for itself (by the way, we haven\u2019t seen that bear in a few days to the best of my knowledge).\" Let\u2019s not forget about 856 and his need either. He followed 402 for about 11 days waiting for the opportunity to mate. As a very dominant bear, he can take advantage of these situations because no other bear has challenged him for females this summer. He\u2019s much thinner, however, than other large males like 747 and 814 Lurch, so 856 was sacrificing weight for the opportunity to sire more offspring.\" Park visitor,Tim Auerwas in the perfect place at the perfect time (just like CalliopeJane always seems to be) and not only observed 402 and 856 mating,but he also captured some incredible photographsofthe mating pair.

In a 7/20/2018 Explore blog titled \"How does a bear family break up\", Mike Fitz reflects back on the events surrounding 503 Cubadult's separation from 402.He writes \"At the time, and until somewhat recently, I stated that 402 had \u201cabandoned\u201d her yearling (now known as 503). While this might be true in a sense, I no longer think that this is an accurate way of describing the event. After reading more about the emancipation process, I\u2019ve come to believe 402 didn\u2019t abandon her yearling in 2014. She emancipated him.\"  2014.07.25: KNP&P visitor and bearcam viewer CalliopeJane (aka Tina Crowe) visited Margot Creek on 07/25/2014 on guided tour with Naknek River Camp and took photos of a sow with 2 cubs. The sow appears to be 435 Holly with 1 small, dark spring cub and 1 blond yearling. 435 Holly was seen earlier this summer on the Brooks River with 1 spring cub. The blond yearling may be bear 402's emancipated yearling, known informally as the \"cubadult\". CalliopeJane reported observing the sow and cubs for an hour before they ran off into the woods. At this point it is not clear if 435 Holly is merely tolerating the presence of the yearling or if she has \"adopted\" it and will continue to allow it to stay with her and her spring cub. Tina captured these photos: Please request Tina Crowe's permission prior to using her photos! 2014.07.27:  Ranger Jeanne and Ranger Roy have abehind the scenes conversationabout Tina Crowe's (aka CalliopeJane) photos of a sow with two cubs (one smaller spring cub and one larger yearling) Tina posted from her time at Margot Creek: [7/27/14 10:08:54 PM]Jeanne: Are you still there?

Holly is now caring for a spring cub (which is hers) and a yearling (which is 402's). Adoption has been documented in brown bears, but it is rare. I've never had the chance to observe it myself so this is a novel situation for me to see -- and a facinating one at that.

For the most part, 402 tolerated the presence of 719 and at different times was seen both protecting her from a charge and charging her when she thought her own cub's fish was being stolen. 719 could often be seen playing with one of 402's yearlings. She continued to follow 402 and her cubs all summer and into the fall when they were last seen together. Note: from the 2017 Bears of Brooks River profile of 719, \"Ironically, 402 is the biological mother of 503, 719's adopted sibling. We cannot know how cognizant 719 was of the events surrounding her development, but brown bears are intelligent. 719 appears to have learned from 503's adoption and applied that knowledge to her own situation. She seems to have identified the risks and rewards of approaching an unknown bear and used that knowledge to give herself the best chance at survival.\"  402 is included in the 2016 Bears of Brooks River book on page 44: Cam viewer, GreenRiver, created this \"effects\" picure of 402 and her two yearlings from a 2016 snapshot: 2016.06.??:  Ranger Anela's Facebook photo of 402 with her 3 yearlings on the beach. 2016.06.14:On June 14, 2016 402 was observed with 3 remaining yearlings from her 2015 litter of 4 spring cubs. 2016.06.16 17:57: 402 with her 3 remaining yearlings in this video by Mickey Williams: Katmai National Park and Explore 5 57 PM AKDT 402 & 3 yearlings by Mickey Williams 2016.06.17: Park visitor, Ned Awty captured photographs of 402 and her 3 remaining yearlings:402's 3 remaining yearlings,402 with her 3 remaining yearlings,402 with her 3 remaining yearlings, 402 with her 3 remaining yearlings , 402 with her 3 remaining yearlings, 402 ,402 with her 3 remaining yearlings ,402 with 1 of 3 remaining yearlings, and 402 with 3 remaining yearlings .

During a Ranger chat, Ranger Dave mentioned that prior to seeing 402 with only 2 yearlings, there was some sort of commotion or ruckus at which point a sow and 2 yearlings went running through camp. Ranger Dave expressed that the sow may have been 402, but whether or not this was the event that caused the disappearance of the 3rd cub is unknown. 2016.06.26:  402 and her 2 remaining yearlings at the falls, 6/26/2016 video by Martina.

It is common to see sows fishing in close proximity to their dependent cubs (402 & 812 when he was a yearling in 2016), it is less common to observe sows fishing in close proximity once those cubs become independent (402 and 812 in 2020).  Another example of this less common behavior of a sow tolerating close proximity of an independent offspring is 435 Holly and 89 Backpack after 89 was emancipated.  Mother bears will often bluff charge or chase off their offspring in the years following emancipation to reinforce emancipation.  What causes a sow to no longer reinforce emancipation and tolerate close proximity of independent offspring?  Do a number of years have to pass before a sow permits this?  Does a sow's independent offspring becoming an adult (mating bears are considered adults) play a part in this?  812 was observed mating in 2021, but was he also mating in 2020?  We have so much more to learn by following the lives of these  bears.: 402 & yearling (812) on the lip in July 2016 vs 402 & 5.5 year-old 812 on the lip in July 2020 Swiftly Fly The Years created by Green River (p 02/12/23 08:16) 2016.07.04:402 and 2 yearlings video by Rob Rager: 402's Cubs Watch Mama Fish July 4, 2016 video by Rob Rager 2016.07.05:  Ed MacKerrow of In Light of Nature Fine Art Photography captured this photograph of 402 with her two yearlings (811 & 812) above the cutbank taken with a 840 mm lens and cropped in close.

There was much discussion about how to interpret what transpired. At the start of the video, 402 and her yearlings are out on the spit, along with 719. Holly (who was known to charge Backpack after he was emancipated if they came into too close contact) spots 719 on the spit, and comes out of the water heading towards 719. In doing this she gets between 402s cubs and 402. 402 charges forward and pushes 719 back. 402 then briefly confronts 435 who backs down. 402 turns away, and then Holly charges 719. 402 then confronts 435 again. Holly retreats to the water but doesn't leave; she continues to watch intently. Things seem to calm for a moment until around 3:15, 402 then charges 719 who retreats.

Cam viewer and KNP volunteer Stacey shared a 3 part story and epilogue of her 7/15/2018experience when hearing that 402 had lost one spring cub, posted in chat on 5/3/2020. Part 1: Hi, everyone! I have a loooong 402 story , so I'm breaking it into pieces. Here is Part 1. \u201cSpring cub in camp!\u201d The announcement crackled over the radio with unusual urgency. It was noon on Sunday, July 15, 2018. My housemate and I both had the day off from our volunteer duties; as always, we\u2019d left our radios on as we worked around the yurt\u2014doing laundry and cleaning up. It wasn\u2019t unusual to hear a radio announcement of a bear in camp. Whenever a bear entered camp (that is, the populated area around Brooks Lodge), a ranger would announce on the radio, \u201cBear in camp,\u201d alerting rangers and volunteers to the need to mobilize to keep the bear separate from any people in the area. But this announcement came with unusual urgency. \u201cSpring cub in camp!\u201d What was aspring cubdoing in camp, I wondered. Where was the mom?And why were we hearing the announcement on the radio at the same time we heard the ranger saying it right outside our front door? My housemate and I dropped our lunch and jumped to open the front door\u2014just in time to see a tiny spring cub bounce off the electric fence outside our building and bound into the woods and tall grass between our yurt and Naknek Beach. One of the bear techs\u2014the one who\u2019d made the radio announcement\u2014stood on the path outside the yurt, his hand still on his radio button. Another bear tech hurried quickly around the corner. Spring cub in camp? \u201cHe went that way,\u201d my housemate and I said, right away, pointing to the adjacent woods. The two bear techs on duty\u2014along with my housemate, a bear tech volunteer\u2014immediately developed a plan. The senior ranger walked quietly into the woods, while the first ranger shadowed him in parallel on the path. The third tech went down to the beach. From these three vantage points, one of these techs might be able to spot the wandering cub. They\u2019d also be able to keep an eye on human traffic that might influence the bear\u2019s behavior. I\u2019d heard the cub huffing when he first ran into the woods, but the noise stopped almost immediately. For several minutes, it was agonizingly quiet as the bear techs slowly and cautiously watched for the cub. I stood on the path outside the yurt, talking with a photographer who\u2019d spotted the lone cub, and keeping her from getting any closer to the searching rangers. Then a visitor hurried up a back trail. \u201cThere\u2019s a cub in the campground!\"he reported, breathlessly. Well, we knew where the cub had gone, and we knew why we weren\u2019t finding him in the woods. But this new information posed new challenges. At this point, we needed not only to find the cub, but to help control the foot traffic created by the presence of an animal in the campground. A note about geography: The campground is about .2 miles (I think) away from the Visitor Center and the yurt\u2014it\u2019s the opposite direction from Brooks Lodge and Brooks Falls. (I\u2019ll try to post a map in comments below.) When visitors check in to the campground, they receive instructions about what to do if an animal gets into the campground. (\u201cIf a moose or a bear gets into camp, what you want to do is get out.\u201d) They\u2019re advised to exit calmly and give the animal space, and, as always, to follow the directions of rangers on duty. So when we heard word of the cub in the campground, staff mobilized quickly to manage bear-human interactions. Rangers and volunteers take station at predetermined key points, waiting with visitors (to keep them from wandering into a bear), and communicating by radio as to the whereabouts of bears. If you\u2019re working at Brooks Camp, you have a \u201cmap\u201d of the area in your head; the radio reports help you visualize what\u2019s happening against that map. The bear techs focus on finding the bears. But if you\u2019re an interpretive ranger or volunteer (as I have been), you try to educate and inform your guests while you\u2019re waiting together.-- \u201cWhy is that spring cub out on its own?\u201d \u201cIt must\u2019ve been separated from its mother.\u201d-- \u201cHow old is that cub?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a spring cub, born in the den in January or February, so it\u2019s about 6 months old.\u201d-- \u201cHow often does an animal get into the campground?\u201d \u201cOh, about once a year. But this is the second time it\u2019s happened this year; I\u2019m told there was a moose in camp earlier.\u201d Time passed, and the visitors\u2014many with cameras\u2014waited for a glimpse of the lost bear. But no luck. After about 15 minutes, my radio crackled again, \u201cSpring cub heading down the beach, away from the campground.\u201d So the cub had been spotted. But he was still alone. The good news, in my mind, was that the cub was heading away from camp, to an area that he was likely familiar with and where he was less likely to encounter the stress of human encounters. We breathed a sigh of relief mixed with anxiety. We knew, generally, where the cub was\u2014but what would happen next? Part 2: Here is Part 2 of the 402 story. Part 3 to come shortly! Part 2Later that afternoon, we heard a radio report: 402 had been spotted at Brooks River with only three cubs. So a piece of the puzzle fell into place: 402 had been separated from one of her four cubs. I recalled that when I first started watching the cams\u2014in 2013\u2014402 had sometimes been branded as a \u201cbad mother.\u201d A large, strong bear, she frequently came to Brooks Camp with large litters of three or four cubs\u2014but raising large litters to emancipation is difficult, and some saw her low emancipation rate as a sign of bad parenting. Ranger Roy was always quick to point out that if you looked at raw numbers, rather than percentages, 402 had probably emancipated as many individual cubs as 409 Beadnose or 435 Holly. And eventually 402\u2019s reputation changed. In 2015 , when 402 became separated from her yearling, now 503 Cubadult, many of us (me included) said that she \u201cabandoned\u201d him -- making it sound like she willingly left her cub in order to mate with 856. Over time, though, with the help of ranger reports and visitor videos (I\u2019ll try to post one in the comments), we came to see that she worked hard to protect that yearling from an aggressive 856\u2014ultimately only separating from him in order to protect him from the persistent older bear. So in 2018, I would defend 402 as a very good mother! But what had happened to this spring cub, on this July 2018 day? How did 402 become separated from one of her four yearlings? It seemed that no one knew. In my experience, when you\u2019re at Brooks Camp, you learn things by piecing together reports from various sources: There\u2019s a spring cub loose in camp; 402 is seen w/three yearlings at the river; we saw a mom with four yearlings at this time, and then the same mom with three yearlings at this time, and no one saw anything in between. The wandering cub appeared at noon on Sunday, July 15. Later that night, when it was time for bed, the last reports were that 402 had left the river with three yearlings and not been seen since. My housemate, the bear tech, was up early the next morning, as always. His first radio report came around 7 a.m. \u201cSpring cub at the gravel pile.\u201d So we knew that the spring cub had come back from the quiet beach he\u2019d gone to the previous day\u2014he was still alive, and he was still on his own. When a spring cub is on its own, you can worry about a lot of things. How would the cub defend himself from larger, hungry bears? How would he avoid the stress of being in an area with lots of people, many of them eager for pictures of an adorable little cub? \u201cHow long could a cub live without food?\u201d I finally asked. This was a spring cub, still nursing in July, I was told; the hope was that he\u2019d be reunited with his mom within three days. Over the course of that Monday, we heard several radio reports. \u201cSpring cub on the Cultural Trail.\u201d \u201cSpring cub on Park Avenue.\u201d \u201c402 near the Campground with three cubs.\u201d \u201c402 at the Riffles with three cubs.\u201d It seemed that the cub and the family group were following an established loop, sniffing for each other, but never connecting. None of this happened in view of the cams, and experiencing it live was fascinating. If I\u2019d been watching this unfold on the cams, I\u2019d have been obsessing about the fate of the wandering cub\u2014and of course, I (and everyone else) thought about this constantly. But in camp, this was one of several fascinating stories all playing out at the same time. Bear 132 had lost one of her two spring cubs just two weeks earlier; we were still watching that story develop. 435 Holly\u2019s blonde yearling was developing a bold streak. And so on. Anytime I saw a ranger arriving from another part of camp, I\u2019d ask, \u201cAny news on the spring cub?\u201d At the end of Monday, the cub was still alive, and still on his own. Part 3: Here is Part 3 of my 402 story. Over the next few days, rangers kept careful track of the cub and of the 402 family group. We received frequent reports on their whereabouts\u2014and while the bears seemed to be looking for each other, they weren\u2019t finding each other. At times, the cub seemed tantalizing close to his mom and siblings. One of the bear techs would report, \u201cSpring cub at the gravel pile,\u201d while another would report \u201cSow with three spring cubs on the Cultural Trail.\u201d But at the end of Monday, and the end of Tuesday, the final reports on 402 always seemed to indicate that she\u2019d ended the day with three spring cubs. Then, on Wednesday, July 18, I was working inside at the Visitors Center. Around 3 p.m., I was sweeping the floor, when a guest came in to do some shopping before catching her evening plane. \u201cHow was your visit?\u201d I asked, as I always did. (I like hearing people\u2019s stories.) \u201cOh, it was amazing!\u201d she said. \u201cI saw the mom with four cubs on the trail to the falls.\u201d \u201cWait,\u201d I said. \u201cHow many cubs did she have?\u201d \u201cShe had four,\u201d the guest said. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d I asked. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cI told the ranger on the platform that the mom had four cubs, and she was really excited.\u201d And that\u2019s the story of how 402 found her cub! Or at least, that\u2019s how I heard it the first time. Later that day, I heard from one of the rangers that the cub had actually been reunited with the family the night before\u2014Tuesday, July 17\u2014near the campground. Apparently, 402 and her three spring cubs had been hanging out near the campground fence, when all of a sudden, several guests saw her stand up and start sniffing the air kind of frantically. Then she started huffing quickly\u2014and the fourth cub appeared, first quietly, and then bawling. 402 laid down where she was, and the cub began nursing. (Apparently, lots of people in the campground took pictures.) And that\u2019s how they reunited. Over the course of the next several days, 402 was seen repeatedly with varying numbers of cubs\u2014first four, then two (!), then three, and then four again. Was it the same cub that kept separating? We never knew. And I learned a valuable lesson from the Wednesday guest at the Visitors Center. When I told her that 402 had been without one of her cubs for several days, the guest remarked, \u201cWell, that mom has a big job on her hands! She\u2019s got four cubs\u2014and one of them\u2019s a wanderer. She\u2019s going to have to keep an eye on that one. He has a mind of his own.\u201d Thanks to this visitor, I learned that the parenting stories aren\u2019t always just about the mom\u2014they can be about cubs, too. These stories have multiple players\u2014and that\u2019s what makes them interesting. Epilogue: And here is an Epilogue to my 402 story. A few days after 402 and her lost cub were reunited, I was outside the yurt with my bear tech housemate. We looked up, and saw 402 and her cubs walking toward us, on the path near the Ranger Station. \"How many cubs does she have,\" I asked. We saw that she had four. As she approached, my bear tech housemate suggested that we duck into the laundry room to give her space. This surprised me, because this was not a required step--most protocols would've suggested that we could stand on the stairs in front of the laundry room to watch as the bears went past. But I took it as a sign of utmost respect that we gave this remarkable family group extra space. And it was a privilege to peek through the crack of the laundry room door and watch 402 and her four spring cubs walk past, all four cubs clustered close to their mother's legs.

Photo courtesy of KNP&P Ranger Russ Taylor. \"The sight of spring cubs elicits an air of excitement. Baby animals in general, and spring cubs in particular, represent the promise of the future and their playfulness and curiosity remind us of our own childhood or children. Raising cubs though, isn\u2019t an easy task. Cubs face considerable risk in their young lives and mother bears are challenged to raise and provide for their cubs until they are mature enough to survive on their own. On July 13 one of Brooks River\u2019s well-known bears, 402, arrived at the river mouth with four spring cubs. 402 is an experienced mother who has had six litters prior to 2018. Her fecundity is partly a result of her age (402 is about twenty years old and had her first litter as 6.5 year-old bear in 2004) and partly the result of a high turnover rate between some of her previous litters. For example, the loss of her entire 2007 litter stimulated her to enter estrous and mate. When she returned in 2008, she was caring for another litter of spring cubs. In 2014, she entered estrous and weaned a yearling cub (now known as 503). She then returned to Brooks River in July 2015 with 4 cubs . 402 can now apply years of experience and skill to help her current cubs reach independence. However, no mother bear at Brooks River is known to have successfully weaned four cubs from a single litter. Since 2000, mother bears have returned to Brooks River six times with four-cub litters (including 402\u2019s current litter). Most cubs from the pre-2018 litters did not survive. In 2004, 236 Milkshake returned with only two yearlings from her 2003 four-cub litter. In 2006, 216 Marilyn returned with three yearlings from her 2005 four-cub litter, but only two yearlings survived by the end of summer. 402 and her four-cub litter in July 2015 In 2010, two bears (236 Milkshake and 875) returned to Brooks River with four-cub litters. By 2011, however, both mothers had lost their entire litters. The last four-cub litter seen at Brooks River was also the product of 402. When last seen the fall of 2015, she still had all four cubs, but by the time she returned to Brooks River in 2016 she only had two yearlings. (One of the many subadult bears at Brooks River currently could be her former cub from 2015.) 402 with 4 spring cubs July 13, 2018 from Explore blog: Four Cubs for 402 Again by Mike Fitz.  Photo courtesy of KNP&P VIP Maurice Whalen The risks to cubs are real.Protecting, teaching, and feeding cubs is a difficult task, one that is made even more so for 402 this time by her four-cub litter. Just recently, rangers reported \u201c402\u2026lost a cub, was reunited with it, then seen with two cubs, and most recently, back with three.\u201d No matter this family\u2019s fate, we can marvel at 402\u2019s determination to follow her maternal instincts in an attempt raise another generation of Brooks River\u2019s bears.\" Prior to 2018.07.20: Kenneth Kearney's July 20, 2018 17:29 facebook post with a video of 402 nursing her 4 spring cubs: \"Back from Brooks with plenty of photos. Here's a video of a brown bear nursing her four spring cubs. I was happy to see this family reunited after one of the cubs was lost. The panicked cub ran into the campground calling for its mother and spent over a day running around the river and lake looking for her. This was taken shortly after they were reunited. Several years ago I saw this bear with her previous set of four spring cubs. She's a prolific mother since not many have or bring four cubs to the river. Everyone around camp was glad this lost cub survived one of the many challenges that bears face when growing up. I'll have more video and many pictures from Brooks/Katmai and my Great Bear Rainforest trip coming soon.\" 2018.07.19:  Cindy Tucker's July 19, 2018 video of 402 and her 4 spring cubs walking by the lower river platform. 402 and 4 COYS 402 and her 4 spring cubs on the lower river, 7/19/2018 video by Cindy Tucker 2018.07.20: Brenda D captured this video of 402 and her 4 spring cubs.Note: Video unavailable as of 2021.

However,on 7/12/19 he messed with the wrong sow.402 and her 3 yearlings were fishing together in the riffles. She caught a fish and was sharing it with the cubs. One of the cubs grabbed a big chunk and ran towards the platform. Lefty was watching and decided to try and go after the cub to steal it\u2019s fish. 402 immediately went after him and gave him some good thwacks. He departed quickly. She then rounded up the cubs to make sure they were all ok and the family went back to fishing. It all happened so fast and it was amazing to see in person. I have a few pics of the event, but they are not great. The light was not good and the fight happened so fast I couldn\u2019t get a good shot.

I was fortunate to be on the lower platform with a long lens...so when the bear came right up to the platform, and paused (posed?) I was able to get an unusually close shot.

I don't know why this is, although I wonder if claw length has anything to do with it. Front claws grow much longer than rear claws.\"  Please request Truman Everts' permission prior to using his photographs! 477 Sara appears on the list of Bears Monitored in July 2022. 2022.07.11:  477 Sara finishes her meal an cleans her paw below the falls platform, 7/11/2022 gif by radioquiet. 477 Sara July 11, 2022 gif by radioquiet 477 Sara fishes the riffles, 7/11/2022 video by JG. 477 - Explore.org July 11, 2022 Video by JG 2022.07.12:  Close-up of 477 Sara eating fish by the picnic area, 7/12/2022 video by Jen Schneider.

An unsuccessful attempt was made in 2017. 504 is a medium-small adult female with a brown coat, dark face, skinny tapered muzzle, and distinctive large, tall ears. In July, her coat is medium brown. In the fall, her coat becomes dark brown, with grizzled fur around her head and shoulders. She has a semi-prominent shoulder hump and lacks a prominent brow. 2017Bears of Brooks River Book: This bear was not frequently observed at Brooks River until the summer of 2016. She was first identified as a young adult in 2014, but was not seen in 2015. She returned in 2016 with two small yearling cubs. One of the cubs is darker and larger than the other. 504 and her cubs appeared remarkably thin when initially seen in July. Though wary of other bears, 504 continued to visit the falls, cut bank and lower river consistently through the end of fall, gaining critical weight for the coming winter. This bear appeared highly tolerant towards people and other bears throughout the 2016 season. On several occasions, she charged park staff and was often seen chasing other family groups and single bears away from the river. Bears who react defensively towards people or other bears are not \"problem\" bears, they are simply acting for their survival and to protect their cubs. Bears like 504 should be given extra caution and space. 2018Bears of Brooks River Book: This bear was not frequently observed at Brooks River until the summer of 2016.

Unknown Sow ?94 with 2 yearlings, RW, 7 24 2016, video by Erum Chad. On 4/18/2018 Mike Fitz commented that it was \"highly likely that this bear was 504.\"Mike also commented about the visitor behavior: \"Based on the angle of the sunlight (which can be easily seen at the beginning of the video), this was recorded late in the evening after rangers stopped staffing the bridge area. Rangers would not have allowed people to approach the bears on the bridge like that. You've probably heard me say this before: At Brooks River, unfortunately, people behave quite differently when they know a ranger is not watching, even though the same rules apply. It wasn't appropriate for people on the bridge to approach the bears. A more ethical choice would've been to remain on the wildlife viewing platform on the opposite bank until the bears had cleared the path. So, I ask the bearcam audience to set a good example when they visit Brooks Camp by watching bears only from the wildlife viewing platforms and designated trails, not approaching bears within 50 yards, and behaving in ways unlikely to displace bears from the river corridor. (On the latter point, the easiest way to do this is to follow the first two recommendations.\" 2016.07.27: An unknown sow and her 2 yearlings were briefly viewed by the Brooks Falls platform on 7/27/2016, video by Mickey Williams.

Based on a few messages I exchanged with cam watchers last night, it appears that this incident may not have been captured by the explore webcams. The bears receded into the trees behind the platform and we couldn't see what was happening after that since the ranger that was present at the platform (understandably) prevented us from going down the walkway to observe. The growls seemed to subside within a few minutes and the tension seemed to have quickly diffused. We saw the 132s 504s the next day and they seemed fine. Glad the unnerving situation didn't lead to anything adverse. Everyone at the platform (including the ranger) was worried for a few minutes.

In summer, her coat is brown with a blonder mane and ears. She has a tapered, conical muzzle and a round face. Her claws are dark with tan colored tips 2016 & 2017 Bears of Brooks books:Little information is known about this bear. When she was first identified in July 2014, she seemed inexperienced at Brooks Falls. At the time, she would try to fish nearly everywhere at the falls where she could gain access. Eventually, #505 settled into a routine of fishing the lip, begging, and occasionally stealing salmon, which she continued in 2015.  When attempting to steal or beg for salmon, she will sometimes stand on her hind legs below the lip while reaching up to grab or catch partially eaten salmon washing towards her. #505 will also lie flat on her stomach and coyly reach out with her front paws in an attempt to steal fish. She has not been identified in the fall. 505 was initially identified and assigned her bear monitoring number in summer of 2014. 505 on the lip video by Nick Dale (published November 7, 2015): Close up of bear salmon fishing at waterfall by Nick Dale Published November 7, 2015 505 in close proximity to a successfully fishing 410 (aka Four-ton) video by Nick Dale (published November 7, 2015): Bear eating salmon beside another below waterfall video by Nick Dale Published November 7, 2015 2015.??.??: 505 photo by Kara Stenberg shared by Brooks Lodge in their August 10, 2015 Facebook post .: Please request Kara Stenberg's permission prior to using her photos! 2015.07.10:  Jack Denger 7/10/2015 photos of 505, #1, #2, #3 on the left and #4 on the right. 2015.07.11: Park visitor and cam viewer, Baby Peas shared these fourphotos from her July 11, 2015 trip to Brooks Camp and granted us permission to share them here on 505's wiki page: Photo #1 , Photo #2 , Photo #3 , & Photo #4.

The day was breaking when 505 and one of her yearlings swam toward the spit from the other side of the bridge. At first I thought it might be 132 and her yearling \u201cCubzilla\u201d, but a few seconds later, another small bear crossed the bridge and followed 505. It was 505\u00b4s sick yearling, that after spending the most part of the previous day lying on the marsh on her own, got up when her mom and sibling probably checked on her. 505\u00b4s sick yearling tried to keep up with her mom and sibling, but it could be clearly seen she was struggling. She could barely keep her balance and walk. It was really painful to watch and a very sad start to the day for me for I felt there was no hope for this bear. I never imagined she would be able to overcome whatever was making her feel so sick. The next time I saw 505 that day, she was only in the company of one of her yearlings. The sick yearling was missing and was not seen with her mom and sibling again until a year later.\" Olatz Azcona Mun\u00e1rriz (aka Olatz) shared six additional 7/9/2021 photos of 505 and her healthy yearling, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5 and #6. \"This second set of pictures I am sharing were taken around midday on July 9, 2019. 505\u00b4s healthy yearling was hungry and bawled loudly, but 505 was not ready to open the milk bar for her cub, and spent some time trying to catch a salmon. Unfortunately, there were barely any in the river that day. 505 finally gave up and nursed her yearling for a few seconds on the river bank, but she sensed some kind of danger and decided to abruptly finish her yearling\u00b4s nursing session and leave.\" Please request Olatz Azcona Mun\u00e1rriz's (aka Olatz) permission prior to using their photographs! 505 was observed with both yearlings in the early morning, video by Erum Chad.

This bear has a prominent shoulder hump, tall hips, and a dark face. An indent above the top right hip is visible, and speculated to be a scar from a wound sustained in 2015. A smaller scar is also visible on the back of the left heel. 610has been seen scavengering for fish in the lower river area in fall of 2015 and 2016.Extremely skittish in 2015 and 2016, 610 immediately left the area when other bears approached. Due to 610's behavior, it has been speculated that this bear was abandoned as a yearling cub in 2015. 2015 & 2016 from 2017 Bears of Brooks River book page 34: Little is known about this subadult bear. She has been seen scavenging for fish in the lower river area in both fall 2015 and fall 2016. Due to 610's size and behavior in 2015 and 2016, it has been speculated that this bear was abandoned as a yearling cub in 2015. Survival is difficult for all brown bears, and those difficulties (predation, starvation, disease, etc.) are magnified for a bear that has had limited protection and learning experience. 610 has shown incredible resiliency by overcoming the challenges presented thus far, and will need to continue to live cautiously and take advantage of any opportunity she is presented with in order to survive. Some cam viewers speculate that 610 is the 2015 abandoned yearling of 171 , and bear monitoring records reflect that park staff also share in the speculation . In 2014, 171 returned to the Brooks River area with two very tiny spring cubs. The smaller, darker of those two spring cubs was lost during the 2014 season. When last observed in fall of 2014, 171 was still caring for her remaining larger, lighter spring cub. The remaining spring cub resembles 610. In 2014, 610 is suspected to be a spring cub. If 610 is the offspring of 171 as park staff and some cam viewers suspect, the following 171 family group history from 2014 would be part of 610's life history: 171 returned to Brooks Camp on July 7, 2014 with her 1st known litter of cubs, two very tiny springers. Sometime during the 2014 season, between late July and early September 171 lost the smaller, darker spring cub. On September 7, 2014 171 was observed at Brooks Camp with one remaining spring cub, the larger, lighter of the two. The family group was observed into October of 2014; 171 and the remaining spring cub were last observed together in 2014. The photos and videos below show 171 and her two spring cubs in 2014. What do you think? Could 610 be 171's larger, lighter 2014 spring cub?

An idylic time, the cub finds some little snacks to occupy it.

Suddenly, the cub is startled and runs back to shore. 171 turns back to check on the cub and panics when she cannot see the cub, hidden in the tall grass. 171 bounds across the water, soon finding the cub, but remains protectively wary of surrounding, seemingly ready to mete out punishment to whatever culprit scared her percious cub!...video by JBirdyHome: 171 with remaining spring cub (610?)

The Lone Cub by GreenRiver (p 07/03/2020 04:54 ) (aka 610 of Brooks River) In the evening mists upon the lake,A lone cub wandered downThe spit road near the rippling coveAs shadows gathered round. She softly padded upon the grass,Her sad eyes searched the lake\u201cOh, mother, mine, why aren\u2019t you here?\u201dThe little bear cried out in fear\u201cWhy did your cub forsake?\u201d By just what means we cannot sayHer life was changed one fateful day.But the dent upon her hipand wound upon her heelBear witness to a violent taleNever to be revealed. How far she wandered, scared, alone,will never be ours to know.How she dug her den in the mountain side,found food for her long winter sleep,Ran from foes and managed to hide.It\u2019s a secret she\u2019ll always keep. When summer came and winter was throughHer journey led her back.To the only place the Lone Cub knewTo the beautiful spit and river too.It was here that she fished,and she roamed and grew. But so lonely was the little bear,She ran from all who came near,For still she heard her sweet mother\u2019s voice.\u201cYou must be careful, my dear.\u201d And then one day, as though by fateThe lone cub made a friend.And found that it was never too lateTo find happiness in the end. Through misty veils of time we seeFast forward several yearsShe stands below the thundering fallsShe\u2019s conquered all her fears. No longer alone, no sadness callsHer heart soars wild and free.610 is how she now is knownand will always be 2015.07.11: On July 11, 2015 at approximately 17:50 Alaska time a single adult female that resembled 171 was observed in front of the Brooks Falls Wlidlife Viewing Platform. If the ID of that single adult female as 171 is correct, then 171's remaining 2014 yearling has been separated from or emancipated by 171. 2015.09.xx; Cam viewer and park visitor, Stephen Brkich, capturedthis photo of 610during his September 2015 trip to Brooks Camp.

Kcanada shared her thoughts on this interaction on 2/2/2022. \"I\u2019ll admit I am not at all objective about 610. Every year on her day, I will go on and on about her. Heck, I\u2019ve even written an essay about her. And yes, here I go again. 902 and 610 had already been playmates for two seasons by this time. When they first started to play together they were well-matched in size, even though 610 was two years older than 902 and 902 was a small bear when she was emancipated. The years of deprivation while she survived on her own came at a cost for 610. That cost remained visible as two years post-emancipation 902 was now noticeably larger at 4 years old than 610 was at 6 years old. And yet, there she is, playing in the sand. Every bear at Katmai has a story, and all the bears deserve to have their stories told. The story of 610, though, is special. She is the stuff of legends. And maybe it\u2019s just me, but if I were at Katmai, I would tell every single visitor of the legendary 610.\" Sub adult Bear 902 Peanut playing with Bear 610 LR Brooks Falls 2020 07 02-2 Video by Erum Chad 2020.07.06: 610 and 902 on the lower river, 7/6/2020 video by Erum Chad. 610 can be viewed from 0:00-2:45. 902 is seen from 2:45-4:22.

When first observed in 2015, 171 was a single female. Around the same time a young, small subadult was observed; that subadult having a strong resemblance to 171's 2014 remaining spring cub. This cub would have been a yearling in 2015 and the size of the subadult also seems to support the possiblity that 610 could be this remaining 171 2014 offspring. Father:Unknown Littermate: 1 Smaller, Darker Littermate for part of 2014 If 610 is the lighter of the two 2014 offspring of 171, then 610 had one littermate. A smaller, darker spring cub. The smaller, darker spring cubs was separated from the family group in 2014. See July - August 2014 above in the Life History Section of 610's page.

I was receiving an informal orientation before my actual volunteer service began, and I was with a group of people, including a ranger, standing at the Corner, on the Brooks Lodge side of the bridge. KNPP had the floating bridge at that time, and the bridge was closed, because the two bears above -- 151 Walker and 708 Amelia -- were canoodling near the LR platform. Viewers on the LR platform were transfixed -- we could see lots of cameras pointed at the two lovebirds. But we couldn't see the encounter itself. On our side of the bridge, we waited patiently for the bear jam to end, and gazed across the river, trying to catch a glimpse of the two adorable canoodlers. Suddenly, just a few feet behind me, I heard a loud \"huff.\" And at the same time, the ranger's radio crackled, \"Corner!\" The ranger on the LR platform was radio-ing because they'd spotted a bear at the Corner -- just as the bear arrived and huffed loudly to announce its presence. I looked over my shoulder, and there the bear was -- maybe 3-5 feet away from me and the human group. This was my first real encounter with a bear, and the ranger we were with was excellent. \"Okay,\" he said calmly, \"I want you all to move behind me.\" We shuffled smoothly and quickly away from the bear and behind the ranger. \"And now we're going to move away from the bear,\" he said, and moved us 50 yards down the campground trail, away from Corner, and toward the lodge. The bear followed, about 25 yards behind the group. \"So now we're going to step off the trail,\" the ranger said, calmly reminding us of the instructions we'd learned in bear orientation. We moved off the trail, and the bear walked past. \"I know you all think this is a good time for cell phone pictures,\" the ranger said, \"but it's really not.\" The visitors smiled sheepishly and pocketed their phones. I've always wondered who the bear was! Was it 708 Amelia, who may have swum across the river after her romantic encounter w/151 Walker? Or was it another bear, who either swam across the river or who came up through the trees between Corner and the Point? I'll likely never know. But I've always been so impressed w/the ranger's calm, by-the-book handling of the situation, which I've tried to use as a model ever since. And that's my story of 708 Amelia -- or really, the story of what was happening on the other side of the bridge at the same time that 708 and 151 were canoodling at LR.\" 15:16: Ranger Russ Taylor's June 28, 2018 15:16 comment: \"Ranger Russ here, this morning I misidentified 708 as being 409. I had watched 409 so much earlier this summer that I started to see her everywhere.

It's walking is a little labored but it kind of trotted to try and keep up with the subs. Here's hoping it does well. Because 708 kept her cubs an extra year, if it is not very sick, there is a good chance it can live on its own. It is old enough.

At this time, she closely resembles her mother, 435 Holly. Meet Bear 719 - Bears of Brooks Falls by Explore Nature Cams and Mike FItz published September 11, 2019-1 2017 Bears of Brooks River book:719 is an example of the brown bear\u2019s capacity to learn and adapt its behavior for survival. In 2014, 719\u2019s mother (435 Holly) adopted a lone yearling, 503 Cubadult. While cub adoption is a rarely observed event, 719 learned from the experience that an advantage can, in some cases, be made by approaching other bears. After being emancipated, 719 was frequently seen following and playing with her adopted sibling, 503. Soon after, and continuing to the end of fall, 719 began to follow 402 and her two yearling cubs. Although 402 would occasionally charge 719 and drive her away, 402 appeared relatively tolerant of 719\u2019s presence. 719\u2019s behavior had several benefits: she was able to continue to learn survival skills by \u201csitting in\u201d on the lessons 402 gave to her own cubs; she was shown the best fishing spots; and she received protection\u2013other bears were much less likely to approach her when 402 and her cubs were nearby. In one instance, 402 even stopped a charge from 435 that was directed at 719. Ironically, 402 is the biological mother of 503, 719\u2019s adopted sibling. We cannot know how cognizant 719 was of the events surrounding her development. But brown bears are intelligent. 719 appears to have learned from 503\u2019s adoption, and applied that knowledge to her own situation. She seems to have identified the risks and rewards of approaching an unknown bear, and used that knowledge to give herself the best chance at survival. 2018 Bears of Brooks River book: The same information above in the 2017 edition with the following additional information: In 2017, 719 was not observed approaching or following other adult bears or family groups. However, she did frequently play and travel with other subadults. Similar to the advantages gained by following 402 in 2016, 719 again gained the advantage of \u201csafety in numbers\u201d by spending time around other subadult bears. 719 is believed to be the single offspring from 435 Holly 's 2014 litter. In July 2014, 435 Holly adopted 503 Cubadult, giving 719 an adopted sibling.719 is an example of the brown bear's capacity to learn and adapt its behavior for survival. In July 2014, 719's mother adopted a lone yearling, 503 Cubadult. While adoption is a rarely observed event, 719 learned from the experience that an advantage can, in some cases, be made by approaching other bears. 2014.??.??: Emma Jeffries captured this video of 435 Holly with her spring cub, 719: Bears of Katmai 2014 Season by Emma Jeffries 2014.??.??

Shel shared this information about the video.: \"If 812 is 402's offspring from her 2015 litter as speculated, then he has been at the falls every year of his life through 2019, as 402 took her 2015 litter to the falls in 2015 and 2016, and 812 visited the falls as an independent bear in 2017 (the year he was emancipated), 2018, and 2019. The below video shows 812 at the falls fishing near female subadult 719 in 2017 -- the first season 812 was on his own. During 719's first season on her own (2016), 719 periodically followed 402 and her two remaining yearlings -- speculated to be 811 and 812. So 812 and 719 possibly developed some familiarity with each other before 812 was emancipated. Near 35:50 -- 812 and 719 (lighter golden fur) are near the flat rock/far pool area and touch muzzles. The bear in the jacuzzi at 37:00 is 503. 812 runs away from 503 when 503 (carrying a fish) walks towards the far pool near 44:44. 503 and 719 were well acquainted prior to 2017, especially because 719's mother (435 Holly) adopted 503 in July 2014 when 719 was a spring cub and still with 435 Holly. 503 was roughly 1.5 years old when Holly adopted him. Holly emancipated both 503 and 719 in 2016 at the ages of 3.5 and 2.5, respectively. Near 45:25, 719 moves fairly close to 503 and subsequently grabs from the water what might be 503's leftover fish.

If 719 is 435 Holly's 2014 offspring, 719 would be a 5.5 year-old first time mother. On July 13, 2019 at 10:05 am, Explore's resident naturalist and former KNP&P ranger, Mike Fitz commented about 719's age with her first known litter of cubs.: \"Of course, raising cubs is a difficult task. Compared to a single female, 719 will not be able to devote as much energy to her own growth now that she is raising offspring. Young mothers often have a poor track record when it comes to raising and weaning cubs. However, that doesn't mean they can't or won't succeed. 94 successfully weaned two cubs from her first litter when 94 was estimated to be only 5.5 years old.\" 2019.??.??:Xander-Sage-2 created this gif of 719 with her 2 spring cubs on the spit during the 2019 season (p 01/15/2020 18:25 ).: 2019.??.??:  GreenRiver's 2019 season art pic of 719 and her 2 spring cubs titled \" The Princess and her Little Princes.\" 2019.??.??: Deon Mitton captured footage of 719 and her 2 spring cubs that can be seen at0:50 &1:13 into this video .: Brown Bears of Katmai National Park 2019 Season by Deon Mitton 2019.??.??: Tom Fenske captured these photographs (#1 & #2 ) of 719 and her spring cubs (maybe on July 21, 2019 ). 2019.07.??:  KNP volunteer Stacey shared this late July 2019 story about 719 on 2/28/2021. Note: Stacey noted the event was in 2018, but it was actually 2019 when 719 had her first litter of cubs. A quick 719 story: It was late July 2019, and I was heading home after volunteering in the Visitor Center. Heading up Valley Road, toward Lake Brooks,I reached a bear jam where the pit toilets are, at the intersection of Valley Road and the Brooks Falls Trail. A ranger -- also heading home -- explained that a bear was sleeping on the Falls Trail. \"And there's another bear, with cubs, in the trees up the road,\" he said. Looking up the road, I saw a blonde face peeking out from the trees. Tired, I assumed that the blonde bear was one of the two blonde moms that'd been spotted at Brooks Camp already that summer: I knew we'd seen 171 and her two spring cubs, as well as an unidentified sow with two spring cubs. This bear didn't look like 171; I assumed it was the unID'd sow. As the crowd grew, the mother bear in the trees moved on, and the ranger and I proceeded up the hill to our housing. The next day, I was volunteering on the LR platform (the bridge) when 719 and her two tiny spring cubs appeared almost directly underneath me! I was stunned: Young 719 -- only 5-1/2 years old! -- had returned with cubs? How was she old enough to be a mom? And a few seconds later, I realized: I bet 719 was the mom we saw peeking out of the trees off of Valley Road the night before. I have no memory of 719's arrival under the bridge that day: She just kind of appeared. I do remember that she seemed REALLY hungry. She was fishing kind of frantically, frequently looking over her shoulder at her cubs, who kept looking straight up at all the people on the LR platform staring excitedly down at them and taking photos. It struck me that 719 seemed to go immediately directly under the new elevated bridge (this was the first year of the new bridge). She seemed to quickly decide that it was a safe place for her and her cubs to be as she tried to catch her first fish of the season. IIRC, we would frequently see her and her cubs under the bridge on the Valley Road side. But we would see them MORE frequently, I think, out on the spit, where later in the season, 719 could frequently be spotted galloping and chasing her tiny coy. I always thought of her as \"the fun mom\"; she was so playful, interacting with her tiny cubs. And those are my memories of 719 as a first-time mom: young, playful and successful, too. 2019.07.??: Thisvideoby Kevin Forey appears to be from July, 2019. 719 and her 2 spring cubs can be seen at 0:07, 0:22, 0:36 and 1:47.

In 2016 when 719 and 503 Cubadult were emancipated by 435 Holly, 719 was observed \"shadowing\" 402 and her yearlings. 812 was one of those yearlings. 719 and 812 were often observed together in 2017 and 2018. 719 returned to Brooks Camp as a first time mother in 2019. There was much curiosity about how this first time mother would react to 812 now that 719 had offspring of her own in tow.Bonnie Hankins (aka NutsBoutBears) captured this photograph of an amazing moment between 719 and 812...719 greeting 812 below Brooks Falls (p 01/15/2020 15:27 ).

On September 14, 2019 Mike Fitz commented at 08:50 about 719's decision to leave successful fishing for her and her two spring cubs at the riffles for fishing below the falls with large adult male bears. Cam viewer, MickeyMartin asked: \"...A question. Yesterday I watched 719 and her 2 on the platform side of the Falls for quite some time. Mom was very attentive. I wondered why she left the riffles where all 3 were \"making a living\" and it was very chill. My question, have these 3 been on the platform side this season?\" Mike Fitz replied: \"Here's another way to ask the question: Why would any bear compete with the other bears at the falls when they (presumably) could make a living elsewhere? It's a matter of risk, motivation, and survival. The survival part is somewhat obvious. During the salmon run, Brooks Falls offers the chance to eat a lot of food. However bears, especially mothers with cubs, experience risk any time they use areas near other bears, and this is especially true at the falls. While male bears are conspicuous at the falls, they also travel through the riffles area frequently. The risk to cubs isn't eliminated at the riffles. Evidently, 719 perceived that the risk of visiting the falls wasn't enough to keep her away in that moment. She knows it can be a rewarding place. She fished here as a yearling with Holly and later as a subadult. Perhaps she was curious or seeking opportunity to catch fresher fish instead of dead and dying salmon. We can evaluate how bears make a living but it's much harder to know why they behave in certain ways. Bears are clearly mindful creatures that makes decisions, so they are not acting on pure instinct in many situations. We know that bears are motivated by needs similar to our own--food, comfort, reproduction, survival--but we can never be certain how each of their behaviors help them achieve those needs because we can't ask, \"What motivated you? Why did you do that?\"\" Bonnie Hankins (aka NutsBoutBears) captured this video of 719 and her two spring cubs departing behind the falls platform.: 719s depart behind the falls platform - Sep 13, 2019 by Bonnie Hankins (aka NutsBoutBears) Katmai Conservancy Ranger Naomi Boak captured this NPS photo of 719 with her two spring cubs on September 13, 2019 (p 01/15/2020 03:41 ).: 2019.09.14: 719 with her 2 spring cubs at sunrise video by Birgitt: 719 & coy in the Dawn Light 2019-09-14 12-16-07-529 by Birgitt 719 and her 2 spring cubs eating on the spit (part 1) video by Birgitt.: 719 & coy Eating on Spit Pt 1 2019-09-14 18-36-54-643 by Birgitt 719's light spring cub with a fish near the spit gif by Blair-55 .: 719's two spring cubs eating fish on the spit with their speculated grandmother, 435 Holly, fishing Naknek Lake in the background video by Birgitt.: 719's coy Eating with Grandma Holly in the Background 2019-09-14 by Birgitt Bonnie Hankins (aka NutsBoutBears) captured this September 14, 2019video of 719's two male spring cubs during her trip to Brooks Camp.: 719 cubs at riffles, Sep-14-2019 by Bonnie Hankins (aka NutsBoutBears) 2019.09.14(? ): Xander-Sage-2 created this gif of 719 with her 2 spring cubs (p 01/15/2020 18:08 ).: 2019.09.15: Bonnie Hankins (aka NutsBoutBears) captured this video of 719 and her two spring cubs during her trip to Brooks Camp.: 719 Princess and COY at riffles, Sep-15-2019 by Bonnie Hankins (aka NutsBoutBears) Bonnie Hankins (aka NutsBoutBears) also captured this video of 719 with her two spring cubs during her trip to Brooks Camp.: 719 Princess plus 2 at riffles, Sep-15-2019 by Bonnie Hankins (aka NutsBoutBears) Bonnie Hankins (aka NutsBoutBears) captured a 3rd 9/15/2019 video of 719 and her 2 spring cubs 207 (lighter) and 208 (darker).  719 Princess plus 2 at riffles, Sep-15-2019 Video by Bonnie Hankins (aka NutsBoutBears) Bonnie Hankins (aka NutsBoutBears) captured this photograph of 719 and her 2 spring cubs in the riffles on September 15, 2019 (p 01/15/2020 15:31 ).

Scooch shared photos and a story about her wonderful memory on3/23/2020.\"435 Hollyproved to be quite elusive for us during our Brooks trip. We were constantly on the lookout for her, hoping to get an eyeful of the curvaceous icon of Brooks River. By our third day there I had all but given up hope of seeing her. That afternoon, as we started across the bridge on our way to the falls, we stopped in our tracks and did a double take towards the spit. There she was! Her coat of many colors nearly camouflaged her among her surroundings but her hippo sized buxom behind was unmistakable! She appeared to be searching for something and we soon discovered what it was - the perfect spot to dig a belly hole. She dug and dug until she had excavated a nice, cozy trench into which she slowly settled her ample paunch. Just as she was getting comfortable, her daughter719came strolling by with her coys, Holly's grandsons, trailing behind. She and 719 exchanged quick glances before 719 continued on her way. The adorable cubs actually sat down and stared at their grandmother. They were probably amazed at the size of her! The cubs then joined their mother in the lake while Grandma Holly drifted off, to dream of juicy salmon and fat bear titles. What a joy it was to see three generations of that family in such close proximity to each other.\" Please request Scooch'spermissionprior to using her photographs!

Do subadult or young adult males need to learn that their relationships with \"bear friends\" / former playmates change when those that are females become mothers? From 2016 - 2018 as an independent subadult and young single adult female, 719 often hung out with and played with other subadults or young adults. Now as a 5.5 year-old first time mother, do those same \"bear friends\" and playmates pose arisk that 719 is not willing to take even given her past relationship with them? 719 would often tolerateclose proximity while fishing and even play with bears like 821 in 2017 and 2018.

In turn, 719 didn't seem to dissuade 812 (should say821 not 812) from his approach initially. Mother bears seldomly allow other bears to approach that closely, especially when the other bear is a subadult male. Perhaps 719 allowed it because she was familiar with 821 from previous years and had played with him before.

SEE MIKE FITZ' JUNE 23, 2019 10:38 AKDT COMMENT: Link to 804 pics only \"Good day, everyone. I want to clear something up about a bear ID. Yesterday during the text chat I mentioned that a bear I was calling 804 last summer was not identified by the bear monitoring staff in 2018. This remains true. Bear 804 was not seen last summer, and the bear I had been calling 804 is really 806. The confusion stems from a misidentification in the fall of 2017. At the time, bear monitoring staff confused 804 with 806 or vice versa. This point has since been corrected in their data, but in June/July last year, I didn\u2019t yet know that. When the 2018 bear ID book was written, that wasn\u2019t known to the editors either. Another place of confusion is that 806 was first ID\u2019d as a male in 2017. We now know she is female. In sum, if you\u2019ve been calling a bear \u201clittle lip fisher\u201d then you\u2019ve been referring to 806, not 804. 804 is an adult female who uses the river but is not regularly seen and not at all last year. Here are a few photos of her from July 2017 (sorry for the poor quality, but I don\u2019t have the original files).\" SEE MIKE FITZ' JUNE 23, 2019 11:47 COMMENT: Mazey asked: \"Hi Mike. Are the six September 2017 photos of 804 in the 2018 Bear Book 804 then?

At 2:29 804, the little lip fisher sits down on the top of the falls, back from the edge. At 3:22 804 stands back up, remaining back from the edge but using her paws to attempt capturing fish that make the jump of the falls. By 3:45 she is edging closer to the acutal lip and extending herself outward, but by 4:01 she is retreating back from the edge. Around 4:20 with her rump lowered, she begins that outward extension in the direction of the lip again. At 5:26 she retreats, moving right toward the fish ladder and getting closer to the actual lip, but by 5:39 the jumping fish back to her left draw her attention back to the direction that she came from. By 6:29 she has moved yet closer to the edge. She continues this back and forth...out toward the edge - retreating - out toward the edge - retreating....at 9:11 she catches a salmon that has cleared the falls. She exits the top of the falls with her fish, no longer remaining in the view of the cam. Note the subadult eating the fish below the falls as the video concludes is 503 Cubadult.

Adding to the confusion of the 806 / 804 mis-identification mystery is the list Mike Fitz provided in his July 21, 2018 09:12 comment where 806 (subadult male) only appears for July 2017, not Fall 2017: (Note: 804 was classified as an adult female, so she was not included in the list provided in Mike's July 21, 2018 09:12 comment. Also of note is that 804 is included in the 2018 Bears of Brooks River book on page 60 with 6 photos from September 2017. The information on that page also includes \"804 fished throughout Brooks River, using the lower river, cutbank and falls. She successfully fished the lip of the falls for silver salmon during September and October -...\" 2018.07.03: 806 was observed during a 7/3/2018 Play by Play with Mike Fitz and Ranger Andrew LaValle, video by Brenda D.Mike identified a subadult or youngadult female as 804 at 22:21. As noted above, 806 was misidentified as 804 in 2017. 806 can be seen in this video at 21:55 sitting on the island. She is charged by 708 Amelia at 22:39 but stands her ground. 806 is also observed at 21:55-24:00, 34:28-36:07, 35:04-40:13, 43:11-43:45, 58:15-59:00 and at 1:10:31, 806 joins 812 (on the right) to fish the lip.

Mckate explains what happened: \"This shows both the River Watch and Lower River views of the fight. This is long, so please bear with me. 273 and 806 are having what looks to be a mostly friendly conversation. Then 806 goes into the river to do some fishing while her cub eats on the bank on the right. 273 and her cubs are to the left. At one point you can see 806 call back to her cub to let it know where she is and the cub looks up, but promptly forgets because its so engrossed in eating its fish. So 806 drifts down about as far as the cam and then circles back up to her cub. As she walks up the bank, the cub becomes increasingly panicked because it doesn't realize that this is mom. It eventually jumps into the water and swims right towards the 273s! 806 chases after her cub and 273 seems to misinterpret what's happening and also swims right towards the distressed cub! It looks like 806 just about has her cub rounded up when it decides to climb on her back. 806, maybe thinking that it's 273 on her back, panics and rolls. 273, maybe thinking that 806 is biting the cub, then bites 806 and the fight ensues. A lot of speculation here, I know. 273 looks a little shell-shocked in the aftermath, but is otherwise okay. 806 and her cub are seen about 10 minutes later walking through the long grass and also seem to be okay.\" 10 Oct 2020 Cub's Panic Leads to Mom Fight, video by mckate-0 10/10/2020videoby Lani H. 806 and 273 have a kerfuffle 10 10 2020, video by Lani H-0 FormerBear broke down the 10/10/2020 events in this very detailedvideothat explains what happened frame by frame.

Mike Fitz commented on this behavior calledgeophagyin an 8/16 2019 Explore Week in Review Blog:\u201cA diet rich in salmonhas consequences though, especially for their digestive system. You may have noticed that bears have very loose, diarrheal stool at this time of year. Salmon aren\u2019t the only thing they eat. Sometimes they\u2019ll eat peculiar things, like earth. This is a bear excavating and eating clay, a behavior known as geophagy. Geophagy is not uncommon among bears across the world. The papers I\u2019ve read on it suggest that could act as an anti-diarrheal agent. At Brooks River, bears won\u2019t eat just any bit of dirt. They target the 8-12 inch thick layer of volcanic ash from the 1912 Novarupta-Katmai eruption, which has weathered into a gritty clay. The clay may help absorb excess nutrients like potassium that can increase water in the digestive tract. In the absence of veterinary care, bears must deal with their own ailments and sometimes a change in diet can help them cope.\u201d 2019.08.07: 901 catches a fish in the jacuzzi, 8/7/2019 video by Birgitt. 901 Catches a Fish in the J 2019-08-07 10-32-26-466, video by Birgitt 2019.08.08: 909 interrupts 901's nap on the closed trail, 8/8/2019 video by mckate. 8 Aug 2019 909 Interrupts 901's Nap, video by mckate 2019.08.09 or 2019.08.10: Izzy52 captured this photograph of 901 on August 9, 2019 or August 10, 2019 (p 01/04/2020 07:35 ).: Please request Izzy52'spermissionprior to using her photographs! 2019.08.12: 901 takes on the jacuzzi, 8/12/2019 video by mckate. 12 Aug 2019 901 Takes on the J, video by mckate 2019.08.14: 901 is seen on the closed trail in this 8/14/2019 video by Lani H.Note:at 1:07 you can see a light round patch of fur on her upper right arm and a dark patch of fur on her upper right leg.

Ranger Naomi commented \"Morning from Brooks Camp. When I thought that living in camp meant more bears and more sunsets I was right. I went to Naknek beach at dusk and what a glorious light. But the bonus -- bears. At first I tried to go down the path at the ranger station, but two bears were right there. So I went further down to the Visitors Center. There was a courting couple, and I do mean courting. I was thrown off at first because the female was following the male. They cavorted for some time. I have a video but can't upload from here. In answer to a question if the courting couple seemed to be young adult size Ranger Naomi commented \"They did. The male has light tipped ears. They both looked young to me. Kara couldn't ID them either.\" Then I saw a sow and two cubs further down the beach who moved away when they saw the couple -- it was 284 and her yearlings. I took a picture and noticed that there was another bear way down the beach that I hadn't even seen. SO happy to be here. (Excuse the resolution. It was the only way I could upload).\"  Ranger Naomi Boak stopped by chat again in the evening on 5/23/2021. The young \"courting couple\" has been determined to be 821 and 901. Ranger Naomi commented \"Okay. The iD's of the canoodling couple are: 821 & 901. Confirmed by the bear monitor after she saw my video. I never saw them mate, but they were definitely courting, teenage-style. Bear monitor and Kara confirmed. I love the fact that bears usually don't just mate, there is actual courtship. I also thought 901 would come back with cubs.\"  Naomi Boak's 5/22/2021 video of 821 and 901 playing or courting on the beach. Happy Valentine's Day 821 and 901 on the beach, 5/22/2021 video by Naomi Boak 2021.06.02:  Ranger Naomi stopped by chat on 6/3/2021 to share that a boar was seen mating with a sow on 6/2/2021. \"Speaking of treats...I have some news and some pictures for you. As I was returning to my cabin to go off duty yesterday, I hear Ranger Nick on the radio: \"Courting couple in the leech field.\" That is an area about fifty yards from my cabin. I head that way, staying safely behind Ranger Nick. And there they were. They had already mated, but the large male was standing, rubbing against a tree, leaving his mark. The female then left, coming towards us and moving down Park Avenue, where our cabins are. Ranger Nick and I then backed away because we knew that the male would soon follow his infatuation. He followed her, passing us within a few yards and coming within feet of Ranger Rylee standing in front of her cabin. Just another day in Brooks Camp. Now, you tell me who this amorous boar is. (we know, but aren't telling).\" Ranger Naomi shared 2 photos of the amorous boar, #1 and #2. Ranger Naomi later commented \"Well, it looks like we have a lot of very smart bear cam lovers here. The amorous bear whose photo I posted this morning is 151 WALKER. Congrats, guys. Good detective work.\" Update: Ranger Naomi stopped in chat on 6/25/2021 and announced that the sow 151 Walker had been seen mating with was 901. 2021.06.14 or prior:  In an article published by alaskasnewssource.com on 6/14/2021, it was noted that the reporters had been at Brooks Camp in the past week.  https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2021/06/14/roadtrippin-camping-with-brown-bears/ There is a link to a video (also posted on YouTube) in which 747 is discussed.

Scooch shared this information about the photographs.: \"Siblings907(R)and 908, September 16, 2019 - The other morning I posted a photo of bear 908 standing near the island. Soon afterwards, she was joined by another bear that I believe is her brother, 907. They greeted each other with a brief session of bitey face before 907 moved on, looking for a fish, which he soon caught. These two 4.5 year old subadults are believed to be the lovely 708 Amelia's 2015 male and female offspring.\". Mazey :noted the following about Scooch's 907 & 908 photographs that help in confidence with the ID of these two subadults.: \"You can see the clipped off looking left ear on 907 in photo #5 and of course 908 has her bra on\" (p 02/06/2020 05:18 ). Bookmom made these observations about Scooch's 907 & 908 photographs: \"Also his more round forehead with a heavier brow and her flatter forehead. Not visible as much in the pics is her larger hump (than his).

Mckate also shared this information about 909's 2020 season using the Brooks River:  \"909 had an eventful 2020 season. The lip was often crowded, so she had to wait to claim her preferred spot and hone her skills. She had a couple of slips and found herself in the J \u2014 once right in front of Otis who was less than pleased and gave chase. Following Lefty\u2019s lead, she tried fishing above the far pool for the first time and found some success there. She played with males 820, 821, 912, 907, and Bucky Dent and had the misfortune to be Grazer\u2019s first victim. She argued with 902, 504, and especially 812 who has picked up some naughty habits from 747. She also had a big falling out with her sis, but they seemed to make up a month later. Here\u2019s my playlist for intrepid little 909 (click hamburger on upper right). May she long fish the lip!\" 21 Jul 2020- 909 Plays with Fish 909 plays with fish July 21, 2020 by mckate 2020.07.22:  909 plays 912 out of the J, 7/22/2020 video by mckate. \"909 had been in the J, but got distracted playing with another bear. When she came back she found 912 there, but successfully played him out. This is a trick sometimes employed by 503 to get larger boars out of the J.

This is how I read their interactions, but of course I could be completely off base. In their first meeting this morning, 910 approaches 909 and is not warmly received. In their second meeting, 909 approaches 910 to possibly make amends, but 910 mostly gives her the brush off. (The roars heard in the background are not them.)  In their third meeting 909, possibly not appreciating the brush off she got earlier, announces herself with a big splash and 910 takes the bait. It culminates in butt biting and roaring. It's a shame that these two are at odds. They were so close for so long, but it did seem like 909 wanted to break free of sisterly bonds last season. So maybe this is kind of like a second emancipation for them -- first from their mom and now from each other. 2 Aug 2020- Sisters at Odds, In Three Parts-2 Video by mckate 2020.08.04:  909 slips off the lip into the jacuzzi where 480 Otis is fishing, 8/4/2020 video by Lani H.

See 409's Bear Book page): When I returned to Brooks Falls this past August, I witnessed a sub-adult fishing the same spot that Beadnose used. The sub-adult was aggressively defending its spot at the point against a bigger bear. It was a very spunky and very vocal bear. When I asked Ranger Sheryl who the small bear was, Sheryl responded, \"thats 909, Beadnose's daughter.\"It was so very cool to see her fish the same point as her mother.

I watched the cub up close as it walked under the bridge. It had only a slight limp and was keeping up with mom. It didn't seem sick, only slightly injured to me. Although a spring cub's life is a tough one, we should remember that bears are very resilient animals. Injuries that would sideline us for weeks are mere annoyances to a bear. Know that bear management is aware and we took extra care today to keep people away from the 909 and her cub. Here is a 10 second video of the cub from just an hour or so ago. 909 coy walking near bridge 9-3-21-2 Video by Naomi Boak 909's cub exploring the lower river and finding mom, 9/3/2021 video by Cheryl B. 9-3-2021 909's cub is so happy here on the RW Explore.org Video by Cheryl B 2021.09.05:  909 and her cub explore the lower river, 9/5/2021 video by Buddy's Mom. 909 and coy enjoy some R & R.

We were approaching that metal utilities box that you often see when going towards the falls trail, when 909 and Bean came out of the woods and crossed the road from right to left about fifteen feet in front of us. They were not at all concerned that we were there. Of course, we backed up to give them room and waited until they departed. That would turn out to be quite awhile! They were chewing on some grass on the left side of the road for at least five minutes, and then 909 turned up the Valley Road. Bead, however, did not, She continued eating until 909 was out of sight, the casually walked up the road to connect with her. Ranger Jeff had a range finder, so we mostly stayed about 75 feet behind them. They continued doing this - going off the side of the road to snack on grass and berries - many times. Often Bean would lag behind and eventually find 909 on the side of the road a number of yards away. When we got to the Valley Road/ Lake Brooks road Y, we were joined by a few more Rangers.

In their third meeting 909, possibly not appreciating the brush off she got earlier, announces herself with a big splash and 910 takes the bait. It culminates in butt biting and roaring. It's a shame that these two are at odds. They were so close for so long, but it did seem like 909 wanted to break free of sisterly bonds last season.

We backed up for a while until the bear lost interest in my wife and daughter and continued to follow me for another minute, when I started to film. Then  I saw a young man (in green jacket) and a boy (with a red hat) stand still on the trail side, maybe brothers. The young man told me I can stand on the side and let the bear go and I followed, which was actually not the best idea according to a ranger we asked later. Although I stepped on the side, the bear still turned to me, and I retreated to the bushes more. The bear then got attracted by the boy, about whom I was worried but didn\u2019t know what to do. Thanks to God, it looked like the bear smelt something it didn\u2019t like and finally walked away. The right way to deal with the bear is stay at least 50 yards away from the bear. Try to find 90 degree turn way while backing up. Extend arms to make oneself bigger and speak loud to the bear to let it recognize you are a human.\" Note: this video was made private.

Sometime after 909 emancipated that offspring, 910 and her yearling were observed with 909s recently emancipated 2.5 year-old subadult in close proximity to the 910 family group.  910 even permitted her yearling to play with 909's 2.5 year-old subadult.

His face sheds out dark, and his ears are widely spaced. In the fall, 68 has light eye rings and sports a dark brown coat with slightly blond tipped ears. This bear has been seen at Brooks River every year since 2007, though most years he wasonly observed in the fall. 68 was seen at Brooks River in July 2013 and again in July 2016. In July 2016, he regularly fished at the falls and often ate his catch on the boulder in the far pool. Bear 68 is an adult male bear who's identity became a source of mystery during the 2015 bear season when a close up video of him in the Lower River section of Brooks River made him an internet star on September 20, 2015. Bear 68 was then dubbed \"Rie's Bear\" for the rest of the fall season until his true identity as Bear 68 was revealed with the release of the 2016 Bears of Brooks River bear book. In the 2016 season, his identity again became a source of great mystery as he was initially mis-identified as Bear 274 Overflow. It was subsequently discovered that this bear was indeed a different bear than #274 and he was then dubbed \"Not274\" until Ranger Leslie Skora, Katmai'scurrent wildlife biologist and at the time, Katmai's bear monitor, confirmed that the bear known as \"Not274\" and Bear 68 were indeed the same bear. 68 was first identified as a subadult in 2007. Mike Fitz shared these 2007 NPS photos of 68 10/02/2007 photo & 10/10/2007 photo: 2008.09.20: 2008.09.30: Add here Park visitor Amber Johns blog \"The Adventures of Amber\" includes this photo from her trip.

At the end of the month, he had trouble moving that leg and appeared to be dragging it. However, he appears to have made a full recovery and has even grown in size.

Here\u2019s a sneak peek at his profile in the next edition of the Bears of Brooks River ebook. Year First Identified: Subadult in 2007Identification#68 is large bodied with a dark coat. His fur sometimes has lighter highlights around his face and neck. He also has light-tipped, oval ears and lighter circles around his eyes. Life HistoryNot much is known about this bear. Although he has been seen at Brooks River every year since 2007, he often goes unnoticed. This bear has been documented on Brooks River in July just once in 2013. Most often he is only seen in the fall. In September 2011, he suffered through a large wound on his lower right leg. At the end of the month, he had trouble moving that leg and appeared to be dragging. However, he appears to have made a full recovery and has even grown in size.

Thankfully, it was a peaceful transition and 747 decided to leave the Falls once he got to the far lip area. 68's heart-shaped head is quite handsome. 68 caught several fish.

Add here There are no known relatives for 68 at this time.However, the conversation about 68 possibly being the 3rd Wayne Brother (83 and 868 being the two known Wayne Brothers) has often come up.On February 21, 2018, GreenRiver asked Mike Fitz his thoughts on that 68 possible Wayne Brother topic. Here were Mike's thoughts: \"I've wondered about that, but I wasn't able to find anything in the bear monitoring notes hinting at that when I worked for the park. His size and age would match both 868's and 83's, but a lot of cubs were getting emancipated in 2006 and 2007. Without any DNA evidence or really good photos of the Waynes, then I'll have to say there's a chance but nothing can prove it conclusively.\" 868 Wayne Brother's page of the 2012 iBook provides some information about the 3rd \"Wayne Brother\": 83, 868 and 68 have been observed together using the Brooks River...even playing together for an extended period of time in the lower river.For example on October 4, 2014 Mike Fitz captured these videos: 68, 83, and 868 play-fighting: Three way play-fight between adult male bears October 4, 2014 68, 83 Wayne Brother & 868 Wayne Brother video by Mike Fitz-1 68 and 868: Play-fight between adult male bears October 4, 2014 68 and 868 Wayne Brother video by Mike Fitz-1 There were no darting attempts (successful or unsuccessful) in 2016by Ranger Michael Saxton for the genetics study.

In July, he often sprots a light brown coat, dark eye rings as well as numerous small scars and wounds on his face, neck, and front legs. Like many large adult males, his ears are wide set. He displays a large scar on his right shoulder from a wound received in 2012. In 2015, he had a large, deep wound above his hips (off center to the right) that appeard to be reopened in 2016 which has left a distinctive \"rump hump\" or \"rump clump\" of fur covered skin and scar tissue. In the fall, his coat is medium brown in color with grizzled highlights especially around his neck. On February 27, 2018 Mike Fitz shared this information that helps to identify 83 Wayne Brother and also provides some distinctive 83 behavior information.: \"For me, 83's numerous wounds and scares are some his most distinguishing features, of which he seems to have more than most other bears. A number of factors could contribute to this. 83 seems to shed very thoroughly, revealing bare patches of skin where scars and wounds are easy to see. Except for attempts to steal every once and while, 83 doesn't seem to display a high level of aggressiveness like some other adult males, so I don't necessarily consider disposition to be a large contributing factor. He can hold his ground well enough among the male bears at the falls, but he's usually not picking fights. Could he just be unlucky, often in the wrong place at the wrong time? For some of his wounds, I think that is a contributing factor. As an example, 83 now carries a scar between his hip just above the tail. The scar is largely the product of a wound opened by 747.\" See the June 23, 2016 video of 747 taking a chunk out of 83 Wayne Brother in the June 2016 Life History section below and these two photos provided by Mike Fitz with his comment: #1 & #2 In spring and summer 83 Wayne Brother will fish below the falls just south of the far pool near the log in the middle of the falls, in the jacuzzi, and in the far pool. In the fall, 83 Wayne Brother will fish the cut bank and the lower river like most bears, but will also occasionally fish at the falls. In 2015 and prior 83 Wayne Brother was observed playing with his sibling, 868 Wayne Brother and161. 83 Wayne Brother is another adult bear that matured along the Brooks River. He is believed to be the offspring of 438 Flo and the sibling of 868 Wayne Brother (deceased October 2015). Even though 83 and 868 undoubtedly shared many of the same learning experiences as cubs, they differed in their fishing styles and held different ranks in the bear hierarchy. In 2015 (when 868 Wayne Brother was found deceased on the spit) and the several prior years, 83 Wayne Brother was a more dominant bear at the falls than 868. Over the last few years 83 was only displaced by the very largest male bears. 83 Wayne Brother is the offspring of 438 Flo, one of her 3 cubs from her 2002 litter. Two of 438 Flo's three spring cubs can be seen in thisOctober 2002 photo from the 2012 Bears of Brooks River iBookwith milk on their mouths; 83 Wayne Brother could be one of them. 83 Wayne Brother, a yearling, remained with 438 Flo and the family group . 438 Flo and her three yearlings can be seen in this video by Eric Jones. 83 Wayne Brother and 868 Wayne Brother are believed to be two of those offspring.

A number of factors could contribute to this. 83 seems to shed very thoroughly, revealing bare patches of skin where scars and wounds are easy to see. Except for attempts to steal every once and while, 83 doesn't seem to display a high level of aggressiveness like some other adult males, so I don't necessarily consider disposition to be a large contributing factor. He can hold his ground well enough among the male bears at the falls, but he's usually not picking fights. Could he just be unlucky, often in the wrong place at the wrong time? For some of his wounds, I think that is a contributing factor. As an example, 83 now carries a scar between his hip just above the tail. The scar is largely the product of a wound opened by 747.\" June 23, 2016 video of 747 taking a chunk out of 83 Wayne Brother: 747 takes a chunk out of 83 June 23, 2016 (AK time) by OhNoIDidn't-0 Photos included in Mike Fitz' comment: #1 & #2 (dates unknown) and snip of Mike's February 27, 2018 18:18 comment: JG shared these snapshots (#1 , #2 , #3 , #4 , #5 , #6 , #7 , #8 , #9 , #10 , #11 , #12 , #13 , #14 , #15 , #16 , #17 , #18 , #19 , #20 , #21 , #22 , #23 , #24 , #25 , #26 & #27 )of 83 Wayne Brother taken between July 1, 2018 and October 9, 2018.: 2018.6.29: 83 was observed and photographed returning to Brooks Falls by cam viewer and visitor Leslie Zane (aka Lesleezee).

It appears that Olatz and NWBearLove92 (see above photos) were on the platform at the same time as their photos are very similar. \"Salmon stayed in the cooler waters of Naknek Lake and stopped jumping the falls the afternoon of July 7, 2019. Yet, the bears still didn\u00b4t know they were not going to find dinner in Brooks River that day and, to my luck and delight, the most part of the Big Boys showed up at the falls that evening. 83 Wayne Brother was one of them. He entered the river near the riffles area and walked slowly toward the falls. 32 Chunk in the Jacuzzi, 755 Scare D Bear in the far pool and 747 on the conveyor belt were the bears hanging out at the falls when he approached. He stood by the \u201chole\u201d for a few seconds, but as soon as 747 saw him, the bear of colossal proportions decided to remind 83 Wayne Brother he was the top bear at the falls while 856 was not around. They both exchanged some harsh words, and when 747 felt it was enough, he turned around and left. 83 Wayne Brother sat and stared at 747 wondering what he had done to deserve that. After a few seconds, he decided it was better to find dinner somewhere else.

He can be a playful bear too. In 2014 and 2015, for example, he was seen play fighting with 32, 151, 274, and 474. 89 is one of the falls well known bears his mother is 435 Holly and 89 Backpackwas born in 2006.

As a yearling in 2007 89 Backpackinjured his right front leg and limped noticeably throughout the summer, 435 Hollywould wait for him to catch up as they walked. By the early fall, his leg appeared to be healed.As a yearling cub, 89 was very recognizable and as a result he is one of the few bars whose mother, 435 Holly, is known. 89 Backpack and 435 Holly can be seen at 1:22 into this video by GrizBear44 89 Backpack limping with 435 Holly at 1 22 into this 2007 video by GrizBear44 By the fall of 2007 his leg was healed and the leg did not seem injured in 2008. Just shows how resilient bears are. During the 2007 season yearling, 89 Backpack was observed playing with one of 410's spring cubs.Former KNP&P Ranger Mike Fitz shared this information on July10, 2017.: \"Cubs from different litters rarely interact, but we've seen it happen before at the river. When 89 Backpack was a yearling in 2007, for example, we saw him play with one of 410's spring cubs.\" In early summer 2007,435, nicknamed Holly, arrived with a yearling cub. The cub was limping noticeably, and it would put no weight on one of his front legs. With impaired mobility, this bear family was competitively disadvantaged. #435 would not visit Brooks Falls to fish and the cub would not be able to flee any threats. 435 andyearling (89 Backpack) modified their behavior to deal with the injury.435 reacted to her yearling\u2019s limited mobility by fishing around the mouth of Brooks River where larger, more aggressive bears are less frequently seen. She also appeared to move more slowly to allow the injured yearling to keep pace. 2007.07.??:  July 2007 stock photos by Pat Kerrigan of 89 Backpack (#1) and 435 Holly (#2 and #3). 2007.07.07: Ranger Jeanne's photo of 89 Backpack with injured right front paw. 2007.07.11:  Thai Ta captured this 7/11/2007 photo of 435 Holly resting on the spit with her yearling 89 Backpack. Thai Ta's comment below the photo \"Holly and Backpack returned this year with Backpack already injured; the Park doesn't know exactly why. I did not see him use the injured leg so he only limped on the good three. He's had his injury for at least a month by the time that I left. As it's nature, the future of the cub is unknown but obviously, it's a major injury and life will be more difficult if the leg doesn't heal. The injured leg is the raised one.\" 2007.07.25: Ranger Jeanne's photo of 89 backpack on the deck of the floating bridge. Ranger Jeanne's photo of 89 Backpack eating the sandbag next to the floating bridge deck on the platform side of the river. 89 Backpack's 2007 front leg injury was not noticeable in 2008, which was his first summer as an idependent subadult. This is another example of the resilient nature of bears and their ability to persevere through significant injuries. On September 30, 2017 Mike Fitz (former KNP&P ranger) commented about how bear skulls change shape as the bear ages: \"Bear skulls change shape as they age. I didn't tend to see this change as something sudden. It was more gradual. This is most noticeable when you compare the relative location of ears on subadult bears and cubs to adults. Ears on young bear are generally higher on their head. As bears grow into adults, their skull widens and the ears sort of slide more toward the sides as you can see in these photos of 89 Backpack in 2008 and 2015 respectively. In general, the ears on older subadult bears and young adult bears (4.5-6.5 years-old) remain relatively high on their head. From what I've observed, the change in ear position is much more noticeable as they approach full maturity after a few more years of growing.\" Below is the 2008 photo of 89 Backpack that Mike Fitz shared in that comment (note: the 2015 photo of 89 Backpack that Mike Fitz shared on 09/30/2017 is below in the 2015 section): 2008.07.19: Ranger Jeanne's photo of 89 Backpack.

Here is their description of the video: \"The salmon run is over and many of the bear have left Brooks Falls. We now find a mother, her cubs and a young sub-adult bear at the falls.

I watched these 2 grizzly bears scrap for over an hour .. I shot mostly stills but collected some video as well. I wish I'd been able to shoot both. Amazing treat to watch.\" 2 Adult Alaska Grizzly Bears Fighting Fall 2013 by Expeditions Alaska This may be the video of the highlights mentioned above: Here is the information provided with this video: \"Here's the video of these 2 grizzly bears fighting. These grizzly bears aren't really fighting, just playing around, like 2 friends wrestling. I should've shot more video, but switched to my still cameras for some photos. The bears wrestled and sparred for over an hour, which is pretty unusual for grown adult male grizzly bears, especially this late in the year - they're usually concerned primarily with eating in the fall. I've photographed both of these boars for nearly 10 years now, it was fun to watch them bump into each other and, like old friends, start to play. Generally, adult male grizzly bears aren't considered to be very sociable toward one another, but I've seen this kind of behavior a number of times. After they wound down, they went on about their business (catching salmon), in separate directions. A few days later they passed each other again with not so much as a glance toward each other. Who knows what was different about this particular time. This is from my Grizzlies in the Fall Photo Tour, to Katmai National Park, 2013. Grizzly bears in this area are also known as brown bears; same species. Love to hear your thoughts and comments on the video.

These two up-and-coming young adults have been busy getting fat all year, for their winter survival and in an effort to rise the ranks of the bear hierarchy. The beefier these bears get, the better access they\u2019ll have to preferred fishing locations next year. And that means they can get swolleven quicker. Bigger is definitely better in the bear world, but which of these two young bucks is fattening up best? 151 Walker was declared the winner of round 1.1.

This bear appears to be 274 Overflow. Photos #1 and #2. Theresa had an interesting story to go along with the photos. \"So, I have a little story about these two 274 Overflow pictures taken in early July 2014 on the falls trail. I was walking with a friend and we were almost to the walkway to get to the falls and we saw a ranger and group of people stopped at least 30 yards from the gate. There was 274 Overflow napping literally on the trial right in front of the gate. The hope was he would wake up and head through the trees to the falls. No such luck and he started heading our way down the trail, just slowly moseying down the trail and occasionally grabbing a mouth full of grass from the side of the trail. After moving the group back several times, it was clear he was going to keep coming, so my friend and I asked the ranger if we could just go into the woods off trail because we did not want to have to go all the way back to the pit toilets. He said no problem and pointed to a group of trees pretty far off the trail for us to go to - so went as far as we possibly could. 274 Overflow continued down the trail and the group kept moving back. When he got to the little bear trail we had exited to the trees, he stopped, turned towards us, and started eating grass and looking at us. Very unnerving, to say the least and I jokingly told my friend if he came our direction I was knocking her down and I was out of there! After the longest 2 minutes of my life, he finally turned and continued down the trail towards the pit toilets. No doubt he was messing with us.\" Please request Theresa Bielawski's permission prior to using her photographs! 2014.07.05: Ranger Jeanne's photo #1and photo #2 of 274 Overflow. 274 was included in the 2015 Bears of Brooks River book on page 59: 2015.06.29 or PRIOR: Brown Bear (274 Overflow) has awkward pose while watching water at Brooks Falls, video  by MSO Belle, 6/29/2015 or prior.

Unknown wide muzzled boar 10-18-2020 Video by Lani H 299 was initially observed and classified  in the fall of 2021. 299 is a bear that we still don\u2019t know much about. He tends to be wary of other bears. His habits suggest that he is not habituated to people or other bears, unlike many bears who have frequented Brooks River for the majority of their lives.  He has occasionally been seen in fall dating back to 2018, but has never made enough bear monitoring scans to be given a number until 2021.  299's page in the 2022 Bears of Brooks River book page 71 299 has been observed on the cams in 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2020 and 2021. These observations on the cams have always been in the fall and usually at dusk or dawn in low light conditions. He has occasionally appeared in daylight. Ranger Lian Law shared this newly identified bear's monitoring number with cam viewers in chat on April 14, 2022 in her comment. 299 was included in the 2022 Bears of Brooks River book page 71. 299's page in the 2022 Bears of Brooks River book page 71 299 appears on the list of Bears Monitored in Fall 2021.2021.09.12:  299 below the falls platform. 9/12/2021 screenshot by JG. 299 arrives, 9/12/2021 video by mckate. \"Poor fellow is looking a little beat up.

There were no darting attempts, successful or unsuccessful,of 474 by Ranger Michael Saxton in 2016. 474 is a medium-sized adult male bear with a dark, smooth looking face. His ears are light tipped and his coaat is dark brown with longer fur on his back and neck. 474 is another bear only seen at Brooks River in the fall. Like most bears in September and October, he tends to fish the cut bank and lower riverarea, although he typically doesn't fish the mouth of the river with many people present. Many bears like 474 are only seen in the fall and typically fish the cut bank area. These bears, when observed closely, are not usually tolerant of the close proximity of people. 474 was initially observed during official bear monitoring sessions in 2014 and classified at that time as an adult male. 2014.09.??:  Tim Plowden stock photos of 474 from September 2014, #1, #2 and #3.Tim Plowden also captured September 2014 video at Brooks Falls. 474 can be seen at 6:18.

The hierarchy on the river has shuffled again with more large adult males using the falls at the same time. I visited Brooks Camp earlier this week and was able to see 747, 474, and 32 Chunk. When I was at the river, these bears were usually separated in time and space. I didn\u2019t see them commingle much at all, except for one interaction between 747 and 474 where 474 appeared to avoid the approach of 747. Based on that and videos of 32, 4747, and 747 from the bearcams, here\u2019s the hierarchy as I currently see it:747 > 474 > 32 68 is also very large and quite capable of maintaining access to fishing spots along with the largest adult males. However, I did not witness him interacting with 32, 474, or 747 so I am unsure where he sits in the hierarchy. It\u2019s reasonable to assume, based on his size alone, that he ranks at least as high as 32. 474 \u201cwon\u201d the fight with 32 from my perspective. 32 appeared to encroach on 474\u2019s space, even lunging toward 474. Instead of yielding, 474 decided to physically engage 32 and he quickly gained the advantage, biting into 32\u2019s shoulder hump. 474 then disengaged, slowly moving away to fish, while 32 sat still and watched him. Fights like this remind me of the toughness of bears. If a human were in 32\u2019s place, he or she may have likely received life threatening injuries, but 32 Chunk just walked away. In fact, he seemed to show no outward signs of injury when he walked under the cam afterward.See LaniH's snapshot here Intense fights among bears at Brooks Falls are relatively rare in early summer and even more so in late summer and fall when salmon can be scavenged throughout the lower half of Brooks River. This year silver (coho) salmon appear to be more abundant than average (nearly every salmon I saw bears catch at the falls was a silver salmon). Silver salmon are usually larger than the more abundant sockeye salmon and their run is later in the summer so right now they are probably richer in calories than the sockeyes who have spent weeks in fresh water without eating. Fishing at the falls now may give bears even more opportunities to get fat. As we\u2019ve witnessed, fishing in close proximity to your competitors though is risky. 32 Chunk\u2019s reign at the very top of the hierarchy was short lived. However, he remains a very large adult male, one of the fattest on the river. While he seem to have free reign in July and August, he now faces stiffer and more challenging competitors this fall.\" When Mike Fitz was asked: \"How often during your time at Brooks did you see another adult male like Otis approach two equally large males that were fighting?\" Mike's reply: \"It's not a common sighting, but in the video of the fight Otis wasn't the only bear to approach. The other bears near the far pool--503, 68--approached the fight as well. I don't have a good explanation for this behavior. Perhaps it was curiosity or they sensed one or both bears could be vulnerable to getting displaced if they approached. I'm not sure.\" Mike Fitz was asked: \"Thanks Mike what are your thoughts on Otis reaction to the fight near him?\" Mike's reply: \"I'm not sure why Otis approached, but I don't think it was to referee or otherwise intervene. 68 and 503 also moved close to the fight. Maybe they were curious and defensive at the same time?\" Flyer 7474 also captured video of a confontation between 474 and 747 on 9/9/2017. \"Bear 747 has two confrontations with 474.

In July his fur is light to medium-brown. He has dark eye rings and a dark face. His neck and head are last to shed. In the fall, his fur darkens to a grizzled-brown, and is slightly lighter on his head and neck. He has a protruding lower lip, tall brown ears, and dark claws. In 2016 and 2017, throughout the summer, 503 Cubadult was seen fishing and scavenging in all areas of the river. He even succeeded in fishing the \"jacuzzi\", and the lip of the falls. 503 appeared willing to fish near other bears and anglers. 503 often plays with other subadults and young adult bears, including 151 Walker, 289, 602, and adopted sibling 719. 503 Cubadult has a unique life history. As a cub, 503 originally belonged to 402, but after an unusually timed series of events, he wasabandoned by his biological motherin early July 2014. Most cubs are pushed away by their mothers in the spring after two to three (rarely four) summers. As a lone and small yearling, he faced many threats to his survival, not the least of which was other bears. Since he was then independent and observed during several bear monitoring sessions, he was assigned #503. By the end of July,he was adopted by 435 Holly, a female with a single spring cub (now known as #719). 435 Holly treated her adopted yearling just like her biological female spring cub. She allowed him to nurse, take fish from her, and play with the spring cub. We will never know 435 Holly's reasons for adopting the yearling with any certainty, but bears, even young bears, are adaptable and smart. They possess the ability to recognize favorable situations and take advantage of them. In 503's case, the reward (protection, food) was worth taking the risk (intolerant bear, injury, death) of approaching a strange bear. If he had approached an intolerant female too closely, he could have been injured or killed. Instead, his strategy helped to ensure his survival into subadulthood. 435 Holly continued to raise 503 Cubadult through 2015 and emancipated him along with her biological cub (719) in spring of 2016. 503 Cubadult overcame significant challnges as a cub with resilience and adaptability. In 2016 and 2017 he faced another difficult time in the life of a brown bear: subadulthood. His survival and success depended on the lessons he had learned and tested his abilities in new, challenging ways.

These cams really give great insight into the dramas of nature. 402 will regularly fish the lip of the falls, even when she is caring for cubs. She is unconsciously weighing the risks of fishing at Brooks Falls versus the reward of food. There may be many other places along Brooks River to fish, but at this time of year none are typically as rewarding as Brooks Falls. As many of you know, cubs do face many risks in their young lives. In the video, the cubs are swept over the falls as they attempt to follow their mother into the river. Spring cubs (also called cubs of the year) cannot swim nearly as well as an adult bear. The current was too strong for them and they were swept over. One bear standing below the falls noticeably reacts to the cubs in the water. Just before the cubs were swept over, the bear was facing away from them. It appears that the other bear reacted to the objects washing over the falls. Bears are adapted to take advantage of situations where food is provided to them. If, for example, a beaver had washed over the falls then the bear might also have attacked it. All of the bears at the falls were once small cubs like 402\u2019s current litter and they all faced the same risks. 402\u2019s protectiveness may have saved one or more of her offspring last night. When you are watching nature\u2019s drama unfold at the falls, be prepared to witness some harsh realities.\" On 07/24/2013 Ranger Mike shared this information: \"402 will regularly fish the lip of the falls, even when she is caring for cubs.

Interestingly, the bear that appears to go towards the cubs after they get caught in the current is a female, although this can\u2019t be determined from watching the video. I\u2019ve seen this bear several other times at Brooks Falls. Male bears will kill cubs, but females will as well. The female bear standing below the falls noticeably reacts to the cubs in the water. Just before the cubs were swept over, this bear was facing away from them. It appears that the other bear reacted to the objects washing over the falls. Bears are adapted to take advantage of situations where food is provided to them, and they are conditioned to attack nearly everything that is in the water at the falls. Almost always this means salmon. However, if, for example, a beaver had washed over the falls then the bear might also have attacked it.

It is unclear which separation this was. Joan Wallner's comment \"This yearling cub became separated from his mom, so climbed a tree for safety in the middle of Brooks Camp at Katmai National Park. This is the cub that was adopted by the famous grizzly mom, Holly, in 2014.\"  2014.07.01: July 1, 2014 was a stressful day for a lone yearling cub (now 503), 402 his biological mother, and NPS rangers at Brooks Camp. Around 10:00 AM 402 and her yearling cub were fishing at the mouth of the Brooks River. The yearling swam across the river as 402 fished downstream. 402 lost track of the yearling and did not know where he was. The yearling didn't seem to know where 402 was either. 402 began searching for the yearling on the opposite side of the river. Shortly after the family was separated, 402 disappeared into the forest at the mouth of the Brooks River. By this time, the yearling walked and ran to Brooks Lodge where he climbed a tree just outside of the lodge. With a few hunderd people moving by Brooks Lodge, the yearling was not coming down quickly. Having a lone cub treed in camp with no mother to be found was unprecedented. The rangers initially hoped that 402 would catch the cub's scent and track it into camp. Mother bears will call their cubs down out of trees with a huff. This time, 402 was missing in action. The cub was very high in the tree. Rangers knew he was stressed, but had no way to get him out of the tree. The yearling had to come down on its own. At approximately 17:30, the yearling decided to climb down the tree. Rangers instructed park visitors, NPS and lodge staff to enter buildings, stay out of the cub's line of sight, and give it space to go on it's way. Any noise could startle the cub and cause him to climb up the tree again. As the yearling reached the base of the tree a plane started its engine and spooked the cub, sending it back up the tree. Just before 18:00 the yearling climbed back down the tree and left the lodge area on it's own. 402 was still nowhere to be found. The cub walked along the beach of Naknek Lake aaway from the lodge and toward the campground. Possibly uncomfortable without its mother, he soon returned to the lodge area and climbed a tree.  Finally shortly before 19:55, the cub came out of the tree. 402's whereabouts were still unknown. Several NPS rangers worked hard to keep people inside buildings. With no planes on the beach of Naknek Lake, the yearling had free reign. The yearling, still alone, wanted its mother. He tried to return to the lodge, but eventually left that area and at approximately 19:58 walked back toward the river approaching the corner where live cam viewers could see him from the lower river cam thanks to Ranger Roy Wood, Chief of Interpretation and Education at KNP&P who immediately jumped on the lower river cam controls while monitoring radio traffic. Not knowing how the yearlings return to the river would play out, Ranger Roy also joined viewers in the comments. The lone yearling approached the bank of the Brooks River just off the corner and began to bawl. Cubs bawl when they are hungry or otherwise trying to get mother's attention. The yearling's bawling clearly got the attention of one bear that swan across the river towards it. To the amazement of many viewing this, the bear that was approaching the cub was 402, his biological mother. 402 must have been near the mouth of the river and heard the yearling bawling.Miraculously, 402 and her yearling were reunited later that evening at approximately 20:08 after the yearling spent nearly 10 hours treed near Brooks Lodge. The family was last seen moving upriver into the forest. Bearcam viewers captured these snapshots of the yearling approaching the corner where he bawled for his mother and was eventually reunited with her approximately 7 minutes later.

The yearling was still in the tree at 21:00 on 07/10/2014(see Ranger Mike;s 07/11/2014 12:28 comments snips below). When Ranger Mike walked by the area of the tree around 22:00 on 07/10/2014, he did hear the cub bawling a little. 2014.07.11:  On the morning of 07/11/2014, 402's remaining male yearling (503) was no longer in the tree 100 meters behind the Brooks Falls wildlife viewing platform. 856 is still following 402 and the whereabouts of 402's remaining male yearling is not known. Ranger Mike Fitz comments on 07/11/2014 at 12:28 about what has been observed of 402, her remaining male yearling (503), and 856 from 07/09/2014 - 07/11/2014: Ranger Mike also shared this 07/11/2014 KNP&P blog: Surprises of the Bear World . 2014.07.13: Ranger Jeanne comments that she has no new information on 402's remaining yearling (503), but she has observed 402 twice this morning being pursued by 856. Ranger Jeanne said that 402 is ranging about half mile down river from the falls since she observed 856 pursuing 402 in the oxbow area. When asked if in her experience she would say that 402's remaining yearling was on his own to survivie, Ranger Jeanne replied that she has never seen a sow without one of her cubs for such a long period of time and then experienced them reuniting. Ranger Jeanne said she has also never observed a male bear pursue a female in the way that resembles courting while she still had a dependent cub. She said she observed 402 quite a bit this weekend, but never with her cub. She said it does not necessarily mean that the cub is definitely on its own, but Ranger Jeanne did not personally see them together.: 2014.07.14:Ranger Mike updates the Surprises of the Bear World KNP&P blog from 07/11/2014. \"856 was still following 402 on Sunday (07/13/2014). Reports of 856 following a different female may have been erroneous. I watched 402\u2019s former yearling cub wander through Brooks Camp alone at 8 AM this morning. A ranger also reported seeing it alone on Saturday morning (07/12/2014). 402 appears to have abandoned this cub. Why? I don\u2019t know. Bears might abandon their cubs if the cubs are too weak to keep up or if the mother can\u2019t devote the energy needed to support the cubs. I also don\u2019t know if this cub is truly abandoned. Although very rare, mother bears have been separated from their cubs for over 2 weeks before reuniting. We haven\u2019t observed 402 abandon a cub before, but this behavior is not unprecedented amongst brown bears. It\u2019s also important to note that 856 showed no interest in the yearling during the past week. His actions indicate that he is interested in mating with 402. He was never seen chasing the yearling or even investigating the yearling when it was treed near Brooks Falls. His consistent pursuit of 402 certainly didn\u2019t help the yearling, but he may not have been the reason for its abandonment. 402 may have gone into estrus and abandoned the yearling anyway. Is 402 a \u201cbad\u201d mother for abandoning her yearling? It would seem so from a human perspective, but we cannot define or label bears with our system of cultural norms, ethics, and morals. Bears and wild animals exist in a world outside of these things. 402 doesn\u2019t have the ability to control her estrus cycle, no more so than a woman can. If she went back into estrus (which appears likely now), then 856 or any other adult male would be looking to mate with her. She would be unable to care for a cub while being closely pursued by a dominant adult male. 402\u2019s former yearling cub should now be called a subadult bear since it is now appears to be on its own. It faces an uphill battle to survive this summer.\" Park visitor Rodney Preisch appears to have captured a photo of 402's yearling on the beach on 7/15/2014. 2014.07.16 Approximately 15:00: Ranger Sheri Anderson, KNP&P Wildlife Biologist observes 503 eating a fish on the trail to the campground that he caught himself and captured this photo: You can see Ranger Roy show the photo from Ranger Sheri's phone at approximately 38:00 into this live chat video from 07/16/2014: Approximately 38 00 into this Live Chat video you can see Ranger Roy show the photo of 503 with the fish he caught. 2014.07.17: 435 Holly and her spring cub (719) were observed on the lower river cam alone (503 was not with them at this time), gif by Juergen can be viewedhere. 2014.07.18: 503, now an independent subadult bear, is treed near Brooks Lodge again.

I\u2019d like to watch the speculation run wild, but you don\u2019t need to be on the edge any longer than necessary. First of all, it is not about 489 Ted. We still haven\u2019t seen him. The news that I have isn\u2019t that earth shattering. In fact, for those of you following the bears closely over the past two weeks, it might be an expected event. Last Sunday (07/20/2014), 856 and 402 mated near Brooks Falls. This confirms what many of us suspected \u2013 that 402 was in estrus. Like I\u2019d written about previously, this is odd because she still had a yearling cub to attend to until it was left to fend for itself around July 9. Bears are full of surprises though. I would be even more surprised if 402 reunites with her former cub, now a 1.5-year-old subadult bear, since she has mated. For now, I\u2019m going to assume she\u2019ll follow the \u201ctypical\u201d pattern for a single adult female and go her own way. The 1.5-year-old will have to fend for itself (by the way, we haven\u2019t seen that bear in a few days to the best of my knowledge).\" Let\u2019s not forget about 856 and his need either. He followed 402 for about 11 days waiting for the opportunity to mate. As a very dominant bear, he can take advantage of these situations because no other bear has challenged him for females this summer. He\u2019s much thinner, however, than other large males like 747 and 814 Lurch, so 856 was sacrificing weight for the opportunity to sire more offspring.\" Park visitor, Tim Auer  was in the perfect place at the perfect time (just like CalliopeJane always seems to be) and not only observed 402 and 856 mating, but he also captured some incredible photographs of the mating pair . After returning from his trip to Brooks Camp, Tim Auer posted in the bearcam comments to share the experienceYou can see more of Tim Auer's photos (here), and read his blog about his observations of 402 and 856 mating on his blog at this link:After Hours: The Story of 856 and 402 by Tim Auer Katmai After Hours: The Story of 856 and 402 by Tim Auer.

In a7/20/2018 Explore blog titled \"How does a bear family break up\",Mike Fitz reflects back on the events surrounding 503 Cubadult's separation from 402.He writes \"At the time, and until somewhat recently, I stated that 402 had \u201cabandoned\u201d her yearling (now known as 503). While this might be true in a sense, I no longer think that this is an accurate way of describing the event. After reading more about the emancipation process, I\u2019ve come to believe 402 didn\u2019t abandon her yearling in 2014. She emancipated him.\"  2014.07.25: KNP&P visitor and bearcam viewer CalliopeJane (aka Tina Crowe) visited Margot Creek on 07/25/2014 on guided tour with Naknek River Camp and took photos of a sow with 2 cubs. The sow appears to be 435 Holly with 1 small, dark spring cub and 1 blond yearling. 435 Holly was seen earlier this summer on the Brooks River with 1 spring cub. The blond yearling may be bear 402's emancipated yearling, known informally as the \"cubadult\". CalliopeJane reported observing the sow and cubs for an hour before they ran off into the woods. At this point it is not clear if 435 Holly is merely tolerating the presence of the yearling or if she has \"adopted\" it and will continue to allow it to stay with her and her spring cub. Tina captured these photos: Please request Tina Crowe's permission prior to using her photos! Photographer Dan Holmes appears to have been at Margot Creek at the same time as CalliopeJane (Tina Crowe).

From what I was able to observe, it appears that Hollly's adopted yearling decided to assert itself over 500. The yearling initiated the interaction several minutes prior when he approached 500. This was more likely a playful approach from the yearling, but 500 wanted no part of it, perhaps because the yearling was being trailed by Holly. When the interaction began, Holly was very close to the yearling. 500 didn't want to be close to the family. When she ran, the yearling pursued and that's what the cam caught. Holly was just trying to keep up with her cubs! Subadult bears, like 500, hold the lowest position in the bear hierarchy. They are easily displaced by other bears, as this interaction demonstrates. If you are a cub, you often hold a higher position in the hierarchy than subadults because of your mother's close proximity. Times have certainly changed for the adopted yearling. Shortly after it was abandoned in July, he ran from everything. Now, he looks confidenet, well fed, and able to test some boundaries. For bear 500, she's going through a stage that all bears must endure to reach adulthood. Holly's adopted yearling may be asserting itself now, but once it is driven away by Holly, it will experience everything that 500 is enduring now.\" You can read more about the interaction in the 10/07/2014 KNP&P Terrane blog by Ranger Mike Fitz: Chasing Bigger Bears . 435 Holly's adopted yearling chases subadult bear 500 10 05 2014 video by KNP&P The title of this video by DTB says it all: For Whatever Reason... These 3 Bears are Family. Noteworthy is that 402, 503 Cubadult's biological mother, is the bear that can be seen diving in Naknek Lake in this video: For Whatever Reason... These 3 Bears are Family. Well Done Bears. Well Done. In the words of Ranger Mike Fitz, KNP&P Visual Information Specialist ...One nagging question keep revolving in many minds ~ why would 435 Holly adopt the yearling? Some biologists hypothesize that alturism evolved in some animals is a result of shared genes. If costs to your own fitness are not too great, it would make sense for you to care for your siblings and their offspring because you share genes with them, genes that will be passes on when they reporduce. *However as of the time of the adoption in 2014, 402 and 435 Holly are not known to be related. Bears also don't live in special groups like wolves or humans where social pressures often dictate behaviors. Let's not forget about Holly's spring cub either. It now faced extra competition from a bigger, stronger bear. Could the adoption of a yearling into the family have reduced the spring cub's chances of survival? Could that decrease Holly's genetic fitness? Will an extra warm body in the den benefit her and her genetic cub during hibernation? 2014.10.06: Yearling 503 Cubadult and spring cub 719 share a fish in this video by JoeBear: Holly's Cubs Sharing a Fish October 6, 2014 by JoeBear 2014.10.13:435 Holly jumps to protect her cubs on the bank near the corner in this video by JoeBear: 435 Holly Jumps to Protect her Cubs 10 13 2014 video by JoeBear 2014.10.18: 435 Holly with her spring cub 719 and adopted yearling 503 areseen interacting with 132 and her 3 spring cubs (805, 806 and 807) in this 10/18/2014 video by yesitsdonna.

Both cubs looked larger (and leaner) than last fall. Like most bears at this time of the year, they are biding their time until the salmon return. They were seen milling about near the mouth of Brooks River for about 15 minutes before they disappeard down the beach. I've attached several photos of the family to this post....\" 2015.06.03: KNP&P Terrane blog by Ranger Mike Fitz:435 Holly Returns with Her Adopted Cub: \"Each spring, I have questions floating around in my head. As spring wanes and summer approaches I wonder, what stories will unfold along Brooks River this summer? Which bears will have cubs? Which bears will maintain dominance along the river? Which will survive and endure another year of hardships in the bear world? Which will become casualties? One story from 2014 already added another chapter. Yesterday, 435 Holly and her two cubs made an early season appearance at the mouth of Brooks River. This family gained plenty of attention last summer when a then yearling cub was abandoned and subsequently adopted by 435 Holly . I received many questions about this family. I was asked one question quite often\u2014since the adopted cub is a year older than her biological cub, will she drive it away in the spring? Last summer, I was not able that question with 100% certainty. Adoption in bears has been documented before, but most of these records simply note that an adoption occurred. Researchers didn\u2019t elaborate on the behavior of the adopted cub within the litter or with its new mother. It has never been observed along Brooks River. Mother bears hibernate in the same den with their cubs, so we can assume that 435 did the same. In Katmai, bears keep their cubs for two to three summers, hibernate with them one more time, and then drive them away in the following spring. Presumably, 435 is treating the adopted cub (which is now two and half years old) like her biological cub. If 435 has not pushed both cubs away by June, she\u2019s probably committed to keeping them until next spring. It seems that we will have more time to observe the story of this family unfold as spring and summer continue.\" 2015.06.14 - 2015.06.18: Brooks Lodge Facebook post with photo by Tisa Hunnewell of 435 Holly and both cubs taken this week (between 06/14/2015 - 06/18/2015) 2015.06.24:435 Holly and both cubs run by the ranger's cabins:KNP&P gif  & Brooks Camp tweet 2015.06.25:Brooks Camp tweet  435 Holly and both cubs are live on the lower river cam. 2015.06.27: 2015.06.28: 503 Cubadult playing with adopted sibling, 435 Holly's yearling video by Nancy Clark: 503 Cubadult playing with adopted sibling, 435 Holly's yearling on the spit video by Nancy Clark 435 Holly and 503 Cubadult captured on underwater cam video by JoeBear: 435 Holly and 503 Cubadult on underwater cam 06 28 2015 video by JoeBear The following July 2015 NPS photo of 503 Cubadult is available from the 2016 Bears of Brooks River book, however it appears the photo was actually taken on June 27, 2015 (see that date above and photo from 2015 Fat Bear Week contest); 2015.07.??:  Brooks Camp visitor Theresa Bielawski captured photos of 435 Holly's yearling cub (now 719) and 503 Cubadult, her adopted 2.5 year old cub playing.

Ranger Dave also shares a photo by Ranger Anela. At 20:58 Ranger Dave  shares a photo of 503 Cubadult by Ranger Anela: Ranger Tammy Carmack, KNP&P Bear Technician talks about the return of 435 Holly's blended family group in this KNP&P video posted on the KNP&P facebook page on 05/23/2017. 435 Holly and the cubs can be seen in the video on the day they returned to Brooks Camp (05/21/2016). 2016.05.23: Mike Fitz, former KNP&P Ranger and Visual Information Specialist shares his thoughts about 435 Holly and both cubs returning to the river together in his Explore blog:Another Summer with Holly and Her Cubs: \"Last week, Brooks River\u2019s most famous bear family\u2014435 Holly, her biological (now 2.5 year-old) female cub, and her adopted (now 3.5 year-old) male cub\u2014were seen for a brief time at Brooks River. Last fall, the future of this family was a target for much speculation. Would 435 keep her cubs for another year? Or, is it time for them to go their separate ways? It may be too early to answer those questions definitively. Katmai\u2019s mother bears usually keep their cubs for two to three summers before separating from them. The cubs\u2019 emancipation happens in spring after the bears emerge from their dens and is not voluntary. Hormonal changes, likely related to the return of the mother bear\u2019s estrus cycle, cause her to become increasingly intolerant of her offspring. While I\u2019ve never seen this separation occur, it\u2019s been described as somewhat sudden and aggressive. The cubs may not know what\u2019s coming. \u201cIt must be a traumatic experience for the juvenile bears to be evicted by a mother who has fed and protected them all their lives,\u201d mused Will Troyer, one of the first biologists to study Katmai\u2019s bears. This is an event every bear must endure as it matures. But, late May is here and Holly still has her cubs. Does this mean the cubs will be spared from separation until next spring? Some evidence suggests they still may go their separate ways. In early May 2008, 408 CC returned to Brooks River with her three 3.5 year-old offspring. We watched them play near Brooks Lodge before they disappeared into the forest. When 408 came back that July, she was single. She drove away her cubs sometime between those two events. Bears at Brooks River usually don\u2019t vary in the amount of time they keep their offspring. If they wean them at 2.5 years, for example, then they are likely to wean subsequent litters at that age as well. 435 Holly weaned her only known surviving offspring, 89 Backpack, when he was a 2.5 year-old. We know that bears separate from their offspring at this time of the year, and Holly\u2019s biological cub from her current litter is 2.5 years old, the same age as 89 Backpack when he was weaned. However, it would be a mistake to use these anecdotes as absolute predictors for this bear family in 2016. So much of this family\u2019s history is atypical. The stress of separation might be great for newly weaned cubs, but a mother doesn\u2019t do it out of malice. Nor does she \u201cchoose\u201d to keep her cubs to be nice. The mother\u2019s biology will dictate the family\u2019s separation or continued unity.\" 2016.05.XX:Add here 2016.06.04 (Saturday):503 Cubadult is observed as an independent subadult per Ranger Daniel's 06/05/2016 14:18 comment: \"Saturday (06/004/2016) afternoon, what appears to be 503, was seen walking around the lower Brooks River, seemingly alone. It appears that 503 may now be on its own. Did its mother 435 chase it off? Did 503 decide to leave on its own? Or maybe it was forced to leave if 435 was courted by a larger male? And what about 435's biological cub? Has it been chased of as well? These are the questions swirling around Brooks Camp today (06/05/2014). We don't have any solid answers yet and might not ever. What we do know is that while the weaning process is probably stressful for the cub, the mother doesn\u2019t make a conscious choice to keep or drive off her offspring. The biological processes of estrous dictates the events.\" Unfortunately, Ranger Daniel deleted his Explore / Disqus account, so links to his comments and photos posted, while available will not take you to those comments / photos. Snips are provided below: 503\u2019s life history is interesting and unique because of his early life circumstances- being abandoned in 2014 and adopted by another sow in the same year. Thanks to the Explore live cams, the interactions we receive from the NPS rangers, and park visitors like Tina Crowe (aka CalliopeJane) we have been able to witness his life story from his spring cub season on. His story demonstrates the challenges young bears face, but his story also shows us that sometimes bears can catch a break. 503\u2019s break just so happened to be a toasted-marshmallow-colored sow identified as 435 Holly. 435 already had a spring cub and she was tolerant enough to accept 503 and raise him through those early years when cubs are unlikely to survive on their own. In 2016, 503 and his adopted sister 719 were emancipated by 435, both subadults have been seen along Brooks River and thriving. Stay tuned this now independent bear has more to teach us as we follow his story forward from here...many believe we may be watching the future king of Brooks River as he makes his way to being the most dominant boar that utilizes the river. 2016.06.06 08:11: Mike Fitz, former KNP&P Ranger and Visual Information Specialist pops into the bearcam comments to share his thoughts: 2016.06.07:Mike Fitz shares more thoughts about 503 Cubadult being observed alone in this Explore blog post: The Teenagers of the Bear World \"Recently I speculated that 435 Holly and her two cubs might go their separate ways. Since then, park rangers spotted Holly\u2019s adopted cub, 503 Cubadult, wandering alone near the mouth of Brooks River. Neither 435 nor her biological cub were seen nearby. It appears that the Cubadult has become a subadult. He\u2019s now begun a challenging journey that will test his instincts and survival skills. Subadult bears are those who are independent of their mother, but have not yet fully matured physically or (as I suspect) mentally. They are the teenagers of the bear world. Katmai\u2019s bears typically enter subadulthood in their third or fourth summer. While subadults are typically curious and more playful than adults, they also must establish their own home range and face stiff competition from adult bears. If they encounter their mother, not even she will cut her offspring any slack. (A few years ago, I watched 435 Holly charge 89 Backpack, her cub from a 2006 litter.) It\u2019s not easy to be a teenager nor is it easy to be a subadult. Subadult bears, like 503, rank lowest in the bear hierarchy. 503 only ranks higher than smaller subadults. At Brooks River, he may wander to the falls, but will not gain the same access to salmon as he did with his mother. Without mom to shadow and protect him, he\u2019s much more vulnerable to attacks from other bears. Accordingly, most subadult bears avoid Brooks Falls. If they do approach, they often do so skittishly, hovering on the river bank or downstream and scavenging partially eaten salmon carcasses. Subadult males are more likely to disperse away from their mother\u2019s home range than subadult females. While several adult male bears at Brooks River fished there as cubs (i.e. 83, 89, 151, 274, 868), 503 might wander far from Brooks River. On that journey, if he finds enough food and space to survive, it\u2019s certainly possible that we may never see him again. 503\u2019s multi-year subadult journey could be risky and dangerous, but if his instincts and survival skills are up to the task, it may lead to a long life. Perhaps 503 will return to Brooks River and we\u2019ll be witness to the next part of his journey on bearcam. Perhaps not, leaving us to only wonder about his fate.\" The following July 2016 NPS photos are available of 503 Cubadult: 2016.07.16 - 2016.07.21: Truman Everts captured this photograph of 503 Cubadult (p 08/30/16 12:04).: 2016.07.17: Park visitor and cam viewer Scott H Melnick captured this photo of 503 Cubadult (right) and 719 (left).

A few salmon were beginning to enter the river that early morning and I suspect bears could smell them. 503 tried the Jacuzzi first, the riffles later and finally returned to the J where he was finally able to catch a couple of salmon, the second one, when I was already leaving the falls platform. To see him carrying that second fish in his mouth made me feel hope for the bears. I was feeling sad because it was time for me to say goodbye to this magical place, but happy and relieved at the same time because I knew the bears would be feasting on salmon again soon. When I crossed the bridge on my way to the beach I saw a school of salmon entering the river. All was going to be okay for them. One of the first things I did when I got back home two days later was to check the Explore\u00b4s cams. Lots of salmon were jumping the falls. I smiled.

For example:-- both lost their mothers at an early age-- both were adopted-- both fought hard to overcome early adversity -- and triumphed big time!!! (\"he had to work a lot harder to get a lot smarter\")-- because of their difficult youth, both became \"just like their country -- young, scrappy and hungry -- he's not throwing away his shot\"-- both were popular with the ladies;-)-- both had a moment that started a movement (Hamilton led the colonies to \"rise up\" against the king; 503 Cubadult led the subadults to start fishing the falls in August) I'm sure there are others...

He has dark, grizzled fur even in July when most young bears sport blonder coats. Hisears are the same color as hisbody and perched high on hishead. He has a round face with closely set eyes. 2017 Bears of Brooks River book: 602is a small, compact and well proportioned young bear. He has dark, grizzled fur even in July when most young bears sport blonder coats. His ears are the same color as his body and perched high on his head. He has a round face with a short, upturned snout and closely set eyes. Though previously identified as a female, #602 is now believed to be a male. This is a good example of the challenges involved in identifying subadult bears, who often move erratically and quickly change appearance as they grow. October 20, 2019 from Cam Viewer Goldilocks, Canada: \"In addition to his physical I.D. characteristics 602 also has a habit of very regularly doing what appears to be a Flehmen Grimace. This is done to pass scents/pheromones over the Jacobson's Organ, located in the roof of the mouth.\" \"The flehmen response (/\u02c8fle\u026am\u0259n/), (from German flehmen, to bare the upper teeth, and Upper Saxon German flemmen, to look spiteful), (also called the flehmen position, flehmen reaction, flehming, or flehmening), is a behavior in which an animal curls back its upper lip exposing its front teeth, inhales with the nostrils usually closed, and then often holds this position for several seconds[1]. It may be performed over a site or substance of particular interest to the animal, or may be performed with the neck stretched and the head held high in the air. Flehmen is performed by a wide range of mammals, including ungulates and felids[1]. The behavior facilitates the transfer of pheromones and other scents into the vomeronasal organ (VNO, or Jacobson's organ) located above the roof of the mouth via a duct which exits just behind the front teeth of the animal.\" Goldilocksalso shared this information about the Jacobson's Organ: \"The Jacobson's organ is used by animals to detect/enhance certain smells. There is some debate whether humans have any remnant of the organ left above the roof of our mouths.When my sister was younger.....she could enter a room....Flehmen Grimace....and list all the people she knew who had been in the room in the last hour or so......she was never wrong.\" Goldilocks included these two snapshots (#1 & #2 ) with her comment: 2016 Bears of Brooks River book: In July, this bear fishes quietly throughout the river. In the fall, she fishes for dead and dying salmon through most of the lower Brooks River. 2017 Bears of Brooks River book: In July 2015, this bear fished throughout the river, often moving quietly as he did so.

He also had wounds / scars on his forehead. See 2017 photos and videos below in the 2017 Life History section. His < wound on his right side may result in a scar that is visible in future seasons, especially when he is shedding in spring / early summer. In the early season of 2017, 603 was easily confused with 856 by cam viewers and park visitors. We haverequested additional informationfrom the rangers in an attempt to obtain the information for this section. 603will be included in the 2018 Bears of Brooks book per Ranger Dave. 2018 Bears of Brooks River book:603 is a medium-sized adult male. He has a light brown coat that sheds out on his face first. In 2017 he appeared with many scars on his face and neck, with several puncture-like marks on the left side of his face. His ears are light-tipped and his muzzle is dark.. He had a distinctive triangular scar behind his right shoulder that may still be visible. 2021 Bears of Brooks River book: Note: in the 2021 Bears of Brooks River book KNP&P stated that \"There continues to be a controversy as to whether bear #603 and bear #68 are the same bear, identified as #603 in July and #68 in the fall.\" The two July 2019 NPS photos in the 2021 Bears of Brooks River book are both believed to be 68 by bear cam chatters. KNP&P has not confirmed this. In the 2021 Bears of Brooks River book KNP&P stated that \"#603 returned to Brooks River and was observed in 2019 and July 2020.\" Note: The July 2020 NPS photo of 603 (68) that is seen in the 2021 Bears of Brooks River book is believed by bear cam chatters to be an unknown boar. That boar appeared on the bear cams from July 6-July 19, 2020. This has not been confirmed by KNP&P. 2017 Observations: 603 (previously mis-identified as 611 in 2017)was observed fishing below Brooks Falls in 2017. 2018 Bears of Brooks River book: 603 was first identified as an adult in 2015, and fished primarily in the lower river. He was not identified in 2016, but returned to Brooks River in 2017. He fished the far side of Brooks Falls and occasionally in the lower river and cutbank.603 was consistently challenged by 32 Chunk. He was pushed out of preferred fishing locations and forced to adjust his fishing techniques. Still, 603 continued to use Brooks River frequently during July. Competition between bears over limited space on the Brooks River necessitates flexibility in smaller, less aggressive bears like 603. Add here Add here In 2017 when 603was initially observed for the season on the live cams, he was originally misidentified by some cam viewers as 856, and afterwards was often referred to as \"Fake856\" after cam viewersrealized he was not 856. 2017.0?.??:- (2017.07.25 or Prior):On July 25, 2017 at 14:27 , Ranger Anela posted this NPS photo of 603 taken July 25, 2017 or prior.: 2017.0?.??: - (2017.08.05 or Prior):On08/05/2017 Ranger Anela postedthese NPS photos of 603:603 photo 1and603 photo 2: 2017.07.?? - 2017.08.02:603does appeear on the unnofficialJuly 2017 Bears Observed During Official Bear Monitoring Sessions List, Please note, the July 2017 Bear Monitoring session ended on August 2, 2017 per Ranger Leslie in the August 2, 2017 live chat she did with Ranger Clint. 2017.07.??: 603 avoids the approach of 32 Chunk in this gif from Mike Fitz' blog: Fillingthe Gaps.

There is a controversy as to whether a bear identified as #603 in July is actually bear #68. In 2019, #68 (aka #603) began to challenge the established hierarchy of bears #747 and #856, the most dominant bears along the Brooks River. He attacked #747 and provoked a lengthy and violent battle with the river\u2019s largest bear, at times holding #747\u2019s head beneath the water. Bear #68 is a couple of years younger than #747 and #856. Younger, strong, aggressive bears may decide it\u2019s their time to dominate the Brooks River.\" 603's page in the 2021 Bears of Brooks River book page 71.

With 128/Grazer making a cameo appearance at the beginning.There are a few interesting things captured. First of all Scare D made an appearance exiting the falls in front of the platform...not a normal habit of his.Also, 480/Otis (who is the actual star of the video) appeared, to me, at first to be using the lower cam housing as a scratching post (at 3:35 min. mark). I realized that he was standing just a bit too far away to be scratching on the housing. Backed up the video a few seconds and took a better look. He was showing a \"dominance display\". He had been peeing as he approached Scare D, and was grinding his scent into the ground with his back leg. Love that the \"Old Boy\" still has it in him....\" Note: Video unavailable as of 2021.

Bear got his name because as a smaller, younger bear, he was easily displaced and would avoid most other bears. 755 is an example of how the bears change as individuals. By 2015, 755 had become a medium-large adult and with his size was able to hold his position more often against other large bears. It seems he has matured into a sizeable bear that can compete more often for space at the falls. 755 also approaches the platform side of the river more often in recent years.

Meet Bear 775 Lefty - Bears of Brooks Falls by Mike Fitz, Resident Naturalist with Explore 2015 Bears of Brooks River book: Like 161 and 879, 775 is only known to use Brooks River in the fall. He is often seen fishing at the cut bank and sometimes further downstream, but does not typically approach the mouth of the river. Like many of the bears that use the river in the fall, he does not appear to be particularly tolerant of the presence of people. He often moves away from groups of people walking through the river. 2016 Bears of Brooks River book: Until 2015, 775 was only known to use Brooks River in the fall. That changed in July 2015, when he arrived unexpectedly at Brooks Falls and fished for several weeks. When he first arrived, 775 appeared to have no prior experience fishing at Brooks Falls and his behavior indicated he was very hungry. He challenged nearly every bear at the falls for fish, even very dominant bears like 856, and successfully stole fish from female bears. For several days, the mere sight of salmon caused him to run and pursue them. He even leaped off of the falls into the jacuzzi to try and catch salmon. After a few days, he learned to fish the lip of the falls without resorting to belly flops. Bears are typically ravenous by early summer, but most bears with experience fishing at Brooks Falls know to bide their time and be patient. 775's frenzied activity showed his need for calories and lack of experience at the falls. He quickly learned to catch fish on the lip, a skill he did not posses when he first arrived. This, combined with his energetic pursuit of salmon, demonstrated his hunger and ability to learn. In the fall, he is often seen fishing at the cut bank and sometimes further downstream, but does not typically approach the mouth of the river. Like many of the bears that use the river in the fall, he does not appear to be particularly tolerant of the presence of people. He often moves away from groups of people walking through the river.

He rarely challenged other bears or attempted to steal fish, instead he focused on catching the salmon readily available to him. Note: 775 Lefty did return to the Brooks River in July 2017 and again fished Brooks Falls. 775 Lefty was initially identified and classified in 2004 as an adult male. Both of 775 Lefty'sears were the same size from 2004 - 2010 Prior to 2011, both of 775 Lefty's ears were the same size. 775 Lefty was included in the 2015 Bears of Brooks River book on page 66: 2015.07.??

She caught a fish and was sharing it with the cubs. One of the cubs grabbed a big chunk and ran towards the platform. Lefty was watching and decided to try and go after the cub to steal it\u2019s fish. 402 immediately went after him and gave him some good thwacks. He departed quickly. She then rounded up the cubs to make sure they were all ok and the family went back to fishing. It all happened so fast and it was amazing to see in person. I have a few pics of the event, but they are not great. The light was not good and the fight happened so fast I couldn\u2019t get a good shot.

This 801 wiki page follows 801's page of the 2018 Bears of Brooks River book, page 83.   2017 Observations:  In 2017, 801 had wounds under both of his eyes in early season.  Those wounds eventually healed, but left scars that were visible the remainer of the time that 801 was observed by cam viewers and park visitors. 2018 Bears of Brooks River book: 801 is a medium-small bear with dark brown coat in July. His ears are the same color as his coat and point out to the side. He has a long blocky muzzle and shed circles around his eyes. His claws are light tipped. He has a small scar underneath his right eye and scars on both sides of his neck. her 2017 Observations:  801 is known to use the areas below Brooks Falls and in the lower Brooks River.  2017 park visitors that are also cam viewers observed 801 on many of their trips to Brooks Camp.  801 was observed by them courting females in the lower river, interacting with 151 Walker in the lower river and riffles areas (was that over access to females for mating or more of a play behavior, that is not clear to us at this time).  801 does appear to be hesitant to approach areas where people are located such as the wildlife viewing platforms (see 06/24/2017 & 06/25/2017 videos of 801 courting below in life history section).  801 demonstrated aggressive behavior on the live cams on multiple occasions during the 2017 bearcam season.    2018 Bears of Brooks River book: 801 was first identified in the fall of 2015 (as an adult male, not a subadult). He was not officially identified in 2016, but returned in 2017. He was seen fishing the far side of the falls and around the cutbank area. Keep an eye out for bears like 801 that are less frequently seen. Their life histories will continue to develop as they are observed along the Brooks River. On 801's page of the 2018 Bears of Brooks River book, page 83 it states that the year 801 was first identified was as a subadult in 2015.  That is a typo per Mike Fitz' July 11, 2018 15:09 comment .  800 series numbers were assigned to newly identified and classified bears in 2017, not in 2015.  801 was classified as an adult male in 2017. In 2015, 600 series numbers were assigned.  2022.09.14:  Chatter radioquiet shared two photos of 801 in chat on 1/25/2023. The photos were taken by Mathew and Kaylyn MacDonald (kaymat), #1 and #2. 801's muzzle scar is seen in the first photo. 801 had not received his ID number yet. 801 was not observed during official 2016 bear monitoring sessions...but he was observed in person by park visitors and on the Explore.org live cams during the 2016 season. 801 was referred to as NOT274 during the 2016 season due to resemblance to 274 Overflow.:   2016.??.??:  Instagrammer Jen Rogers posted this 2016 season photo of 801.

Bear ID\u2019s can be tricky, even for seasoned bear viewers. As bears shed, change color, gain weight, heal and gain new scars, they can sometimes be mixed up with each other. Add in the fact that new bears can show up on the scene at any point, and it\u2019s a wonder we don\u2019t confuse more bears for one another. This July, a new bear, possibly one that has visited in past fall months, has been making frequent visits to the falls. He has been identified by many as 274 \u201cOverflow,\u201d because of a similar shed pattern around his face and neck. However, there are some striking differences between these two bears. In contrast to 274, this bear has a more roman nose, and distinctive scarring around his face and neck. The most distinctive scar runs horizontally all the way across his left shoulder, though it will likely not be visible after his winter coat grows in. This new bear also has much wider set ears than 274. We know from his size and presence of genitalia that this new bear is a male, though age has not been determined.  Some interesting behavioral characteristics are unique as well. The mystery bear, as I have been calling him, takes almost all his fish to the far rock to eat. By the time he has filled up on fish and left the falls for the day, a pile of skin-stripped salmon carcasses are piled on his favorite river boulder. Our mystery bear is also slightly more aggressive than 274. Though not a fish stealer (as 274 has been observed practicing) and not significantly larger than 274, the mystery bear has challenged 480 and 755 for fishing access on more than one occasion. Within a few days of his arrival, this new bear has firmly established himself as a medium-high ranking bear in the Brooks Falls bear hierarchy.  I was at first puzzled by the appearance of this new mystery bear. I looked through the bear ID book and bear management records, thinking over and over, \u201cI must be missing something.\u201d He did resemble 274, and although some viewers in the chat referred to him as such, I was unconvinced. Still, I had no alternative answer. It wasn\u2019t until a week later that I was at the falls during one of Ranger Leslie\u2019s monitoring sessions that I was able to confirm my suspicion, that this was a new bear to visit the falls. Ranger Leslie has suggested that the mystery bear looks familiar, and perhaps has visited the river in the fall months, though she is not certain. Numbers are generally assigned at the end of each season for bears who are new to the Brooks River, or who are on their own for their first season. We will have to wait to see whether our mystery bear gets a new number, or whether a more obscure bear will be entering into our scope of awareness. Either way, look out for him in next year\u2019s update of the bear ID book.\" 2016.08.04: 801 backs into 410's spot, 8/4/2016 video by Brenda D. Note: Video unavailable as of 2021.

Adult male bear 611 was also on Ranger Leslie's possibilities list as an ID for that adult male observed with the wounds / scars under both eyes in spring / summer of 2017.  It turns out that bear 801 was eventually identified as the adult male bear that was observed during spring / summer of 2017 with the wounds / scars under both eye, not bear 611.   801 was observed during official 2017 bear monitoring sessions. Sometime in early season 2017, Jon Rayeski captured 801 with 151 Walker at approximately 2:33 into this video: Alaska Bears 2017 (801 with 151 Walker at approximately 2 33 mark) video by Jon Rayeski Cam viewer bearly shared photos of 151 Walker and 801 play fighting, possibly at the same time as Jon Rayeski's 2017 video (above).

(July 2016 blog post)  Bear with me while I attempt to explain the ID confusion surrounding this boar: When this new-to-us bear showed up (July 2016) many of us called him Not274 (based on Ranger suggestions) and at the end of 2016 he was ID'd as 68 by KNP. Note the scar (shaped like ~) on the right side of his muzzle. In the most recent ebook (2018) the pics on 68's page dated July 2016 are the bear with the ~ scar on nose. This bear showed up in summer 2017 but at first it was hard to tell he had the same ~ scar on his muzzle. At the end of the year KNP tentatively ID'd as 603 but revised to 801 by the time the 2018 ebook was completed. Many chatters believe Not274 = 801. However until KNP revises the ID for the July 2016 photos (currently ID'd as 68) the ebook and wiki may reflect ID's that I believe are wrong.  The conflicting info made it very difficult to update the wiki which is why some of the info for this bear is found under different IDs. Bear ID's are not easy!!\" 2019.07.01: Shel captured these snapshots (#1 , #2 , #3 , #4 , #5 , #6 & #7 ) of 801 sitting near the rock in the far pool (p 07/01/2019 06:49 ).: 801 in the far pool video by Lani H.: 801 (?) in the far pool 7 1 2019 by Lani H 801 and the unidentified 2019 medium brown adult male (could this be the real 603?) in the far pool together video by McKate.

When he's displaced from what seems to be his preferred spot by the flat rock, he sometimes sits above the falls, appearing to wait for his spot by the flat rock to become available again. To a lesser degree, he periodically fishes other spots at the falls too, such as by the fish ladder, and I've seen him fish the jacuzzi a few times too. If I recall correctly, I saw him fish the jacuzzi at least twice in 2019, and he did a lot of belly flop type splashing and flouncing around in the process. 801 in or near the jacuzzi - 8/2/19. His muzzle scar is visible in the first two pics. Except for the flopping/splashing around, he somewhat resembled 68 when in the jacuzzi on 8/2/19, and he was sometimes identified as 68 at the time.\"  Birgitt captured 8/2/2019 video of 801's splash style in the jacuzzi. 801's Splash Style for the J 2019-08-02 15-00-25-918, video by Birgitt 2019.08.02-08.05:  Goof_n shared this 8/3/2019 photo of 801 (left) 480 Otis (center) and 634 Popeye (right) on 5/6/2020.

It is common to see sows fishing in close proximity to their dependent cubs (402 & 812 when he was a yearling in 2016), it is less common to observe sows fishing in close proximity once those cubs become independent (402 and 812 in 2020).  Another example of this less common behavior of a sow tolerating close proximity of an independent offspring is 435 Holly and 89 Backpack after 89 was emancipated.  Mother bears will often bluff charge or chase off their offspring in the years following emancipation to reinforce emancipation.  What causes a sow to no longer reinforce emancipation and tolerate close proximity of independent offspring?  Do a number of years have to pass before a sow permits this?

Shel included a video and snapshots of 812 alone and 812 with 719. \"If 812 is 402's offspring from her 2015 litter as speculated, then he has been at the falls every year of his life through 2019, as 402 took her 2015 litter to the falls in 2015 and 2016, and 812 visited the falls as an independent bear in 2017 (the year he was emancipated), 2018, and 2019. The below video shows 812 at the falls fishing near female subadult 719 in 2017 -- the first season 812 was on his own. During 719's first season on her own (2016), 719 periodically followed 402 and her two remaining yearlings -- speculated to be 811 and 812. So 812 and 719 possibly developed some familiarity with each other before 812 was emancipated. Near 35:50-- 812 and 719 (lighter golden fur) are near the flat rock/far pool area and touch muzzles. The bear in the jacuzzi at 37:00is 503. 812 runs away from 503 when 503 (carrying a fish) walks towards the far pool near 44:44. 503 and 719 were well acquainted prior to 2017, especially because 719's mother (435 Holly) adopted 503 in July 2014 when 719 was a spring cub and still with 435 Holly. 503 was roughly 1.5 years old when Holly adopted him. Holly emancipated both 503 and 719 in 2016 at the ages of 3.5 and 2.5, respectively. Near 45:25, 719 moves fairly close to 503 and subsequently grabs from the water what might be 503's leftover fish.

Second image (2nd image is on 909's Bear Book Page): When I returned to Brooks Falls this past August, I witnessed a sub-adult fishing the same spot that Beadnose used. The sub-adult was aggressively defending its spot at the point against a bigger bear. It was a very spunky and very vocal bear. When I asked Ranger Sheryl who the small bear was, Sheryl responded, \"thats 909, Beadnose's daughter.\" It was so very cool to see her fish the same point as her mother.\" Please request Mark Kostich's permission prior to using his photos!

When I asked Ranger Sheryl who the small bear was, Sheryl responded, \"thats 909, Beadnose's daughter.\"It was so very cool to see her fish the same point as her mother.

You may have noticed that bears have very loose, diarrheal stool at this time of year. Salmon aren\u2019t the only thing they eat. Sometimes they\u2019ll eat peculiar things, like earth. This is a bear excavating and eating clay, a behavior known as geophagy. Geophagy is not uncommon among bears across the world. The papers I\u2019ve read on it suggest that could act as an anti-diarrheal agent. At Brooks River, bears won\u2019t eat just any bit of dirt. They target the 8-12 inch thick layer of volcanic ash from the 1912 Novarupta-Katmai eruption, which has weathered into a gritty clay. The clay may help absorb excess nutrients like potassium that can increase water in the digestive tract. In the absence of veterinary care, bears must deal with their own ailments and sometimes a change in diet can help them cope.\u201d 11 Aug 2019 821 Pepper Eats Clay (Geophagy), video by mckate 821 bounces on log video by mckate.Mostly 821was just really distracting 806 and 812 and even attracted the attention of 480 Otis.: 11 Aug 2019 821 Pepper Bounces Log by mckate-0 2019.08.12:  821 make 9 lip sitting catches, 8/12/2019 video by mckate. 2019.08.14: 821 and 831 play & feed on lower river video by Birgitt.: 821 & 831 Play & Feed on LR 2019-08-14 20-45-29-938 by Birgitt 909 invites 821 to play video by mckate.

Do subadult or young adult males need to learn that their relationships with \"bear friends\" / former playmates change when those that are females become mothers? From 2016 - 2018 as an independent subadult and young single adult female, 719 often hung out with and played with other subadults or young adults. Now as a 5.5 year-old first time mother, do those same \"bear friends\" and playmates pose arisk that 719 is not willing to take even given her past relationship with them? 719 would often tolerateclose proximity while fishing and even play with bears like 821in 2017 and 2018. On September 22, 2019, what appears to begin as a \"friendly meeting\" between 719 and 821, where 719 appears to tolerate 821 in close proximity to her, but that quicklychanges to 719 protectingher two spring cubs, her 1st known litter, from 821 when he makes a move toward her cubs that 719 is not comfortable with .: LuvBear's Lower River North cam viewvideo.: 719 jumps 821 No playing with my cubs 9 22 19 by LuvBears (Lower River North cam view)-1 Cruiser'svideofrom the Lower River East cam.: 719 protects coy from 821 Sep 22 2019 by Cruiser (Lower River East cam view)-0 Birgitt's video of footage from the Lower River Northcam of the 821 & 719 interaction: 719 & 821 Meet & Greet RW Cam 2019-09-22 9-05-07-281 by Birgitt Arlene Beech (aka Homebird) Lower River East cam viewvideo.: \"You scared my cubs!\" Brooks River. 22 September 2019 by Arlene Beech (aka Homebird) (Lower River East cam view)-0 Cam viewers captured these snapshots of 821's behavior after his interaction with 719 and her 2 spring cubs: Bookmom captured this snapshot* (p08:07).

When I watch the extended replay, it seemed that 821 was curious and had playful intentions regarding 719. In turn, 719 didn't seem to dissuade 812 from his approach initially. Mother bears seldomly allow other bears to approach that closely, especially when the other bear is a subadult male. Perhaps 719 allowed it because she was familiar with 821 from previous years and had played with him before. Whatever the reason, when 821 seemed like was going to chase the cubs, 719 intervened and sent a clear message to 821 to stay away. Throughout the interaction, 719's cubs didn't seem comfortable with the close proximity of another bear.\" Then continuing in reply to: \"Have you ever seen a similar situation where a sow didn't immediately charge a subadult male who was that close to her cubs (before he tried to approach the cubs).\" Mike's September 22, 2019 15:58 comment: \"I can't recall an equivalent situation that I've witnessed.\" Mike's September 22, 2019 15:32 commentregarding the 719 family group's interaction with 821.: \"Yes, that was interesting to see.

Ranger Naomi commented \"Morning from Brooks Camp. When I thought that living in camp meant more bears and more sunsets I was right. I went to Naknek beach at dusk and what a glorious light. But the bonus -- bears. At first I tried to go down the path at the ranger station, but two bears were right there. So I went further down to the Visitors Center. There was a courting couple, and I do mean courting. I was thrown off at first because the female was following the male. They cavorted for some time. I have a video but can't upload from here. In answer to a question if the courting couple seemed to be young adult size Ranger Naomi commented \"They did. The male has light tipped ears. They both looked young to me. Kara couldn't ID them either.\" Then I saw a sow and two cubs further down the beach who moved away when they saw the couple -- it was 284 and her yearlings. I took a picture and noticed that there was another bear way down the beach that I hadn't even seen. SO happy to be here. (Excuse the resolution. It was the only way I could upload).\"  Ranger Naomi Boak stopped by chat again in the evening on 5/23/2021. The young \"courting couple\" has been determined to be 821 and 901. Ranger Naomi commented \"Okay. The iD's of the canoodling couple are: 821 & 901. Confirmed by the bear monitor after she saw my video. I never saw them mate, but they were definitely courting, teenage-style. Bear monitor and Kara confirmed. I love the fact that bears usually don't just mate, there is actual courtship. I also thought 901 would come back with cubs.\"  Naomi Boak's 5/22/2021 video of 821 and 901 playing or courting on the beach.

In this instance 856 and 402 mated in 2010. Therefore, it is possible 856 killed his own offspring.

In Katmai, most male bears do not have the opportunity to mate with females until they are in their early to mid teens\u2014an age when they are large enough to compete other adult males for access to females. However, the hierarchy can change quickly, even within the same season. Therefore most bears, like 856, are adapted to take advantage of their position in the hierarchy. In early season 2014, 856 was observed appearing to attempt to court 402; but 402 still had a yearling cub in her care.   Tim Auer captured some great photographs and wrote a blog abuot his observations of 856 with 402.   2014.06.29 - 2014.07.05:  856 was observed courting 708 Amelia the week prior to July 12, 2014.: An NPS photo by Ranger Michael Fitz appears in the July 15, 2014 Katmai Terrane blog: Being Dominant .  Ranger Jeanne commented on July 12, 2014 that 856 was courting 708 Amelia last week (which would have been between June 29, 2014 and July 5, 2014).: In July 2014, 856 spent considerable time courting females. Consequently, he was noticeably skinnier than 747 \"Colbert\" or 814 Lurch by the end of that month.  856 continued his soap opera-like relationship with 402. While she was still caring for a yearling cub (now identified as 503 Cubadult ) from her 2013 litter, 402 apparently went into estrus, abandoned the cub, and after an extended courtship period of 11 days she mated with 856.  2014.07.??

Ranger Jeanne said that 402 is ranging about half mile down river from the falls since she observed 856 pursuing 402 in the oxbow area.  When asked if in her experience she would say that 402's remaining yearling was on his own to survivie, Ranger Jeanne replied that she has never seen a sow without one of her cubs for such a long period of time and then experienced them reuniting.  Ranger Jeanne said she has also never observed a male bear pursue a female in the way that resembles courting while she still had a dependent cub.  She said she observed 402 quite a bit this weekend, but never with her cub.  She said it does not necessarily mean that the cub is definitely on its own, but Ranger Jeanne did not personally see them together.: 2014.07.14:  856 was observed mating with 708 Amelia.

A powerful bear. The reigning dominant bear for quite a few years. One of the scariest bears on the river, if not THE scariest, in my opinion. In 2017, the ordered world of Brooks River\u2019s \u201cbear town\u201d was turned upside down when he showed up on camera at Brooks Falls, injured and limping. He could no longer hold his top position in the bear hierarchy. Until 747, second in the hierarchy, showed up extremely late and asserted his position as \u201cking\u201d, a bit of chaos ensued. 32 Chunk took over as the dominant bear but was, in my opinion, too \u201cnice\u201d to hold it. Popeye, also wounded and limping, was unable to establish dominance. On a number of days, the sows took over the falls, and it was overrun by cubs and subadults. In the spring of 2018, bear cam watchers held their breath as they waited to see what would happen that season. The Katmai rangers indicated that, once having fallen from the top, it was very unlikely a bear would ever be able to regain his position as the dominant bear. But, once again, our Brooks River bears broke the \u201crules\u201d. 856 came back with a vengeance. He physically challenged the huge 747 and won, thus reestablishing his dominant position. Throughout the 2018 season he continually proved his top place in the bear hierarchy, even once to an unfortunate extreme. 856 was again the reigning dominant bear. Will he hold onto that position in 2019? The brown bear cams will tell the tale. Here is a slide show video I made in 2017 when he fell from the top.

Last summer, however, he was unable to maintain that position, possibly due to a leg injury. As I wrote previously, the hierarchy at Brooks Falls  was fated to shuffle. Each interaction between bears can help us understand the organization of the hierarchy a little further. Several interactions between 856 and other bears provide evidence that he may be, once again, subordinate to no other bear. Bear 856 Displaces 747 from the Jacuzzi In the video above, bear 747 sits in the plunge pool below Brooks Falls, a spot nicknamed the jacuzzi. You can see him turn and begin to move out of the jacuzzi as another bear approaches. The other bear is 856. 747 is very large, perhaps larger than 856, but although size does matter in the bear world, disposition also plays a big role. 856 is consistently more assertive than 747. 856\u2019s directed approach toward him is an obvious challenge: get out of my way or else! 747 doesn\u2019t seem willing to challenge 856 in a physical fight. Under these circumstances, if 747 turned away then he would expose rear flank to attack. Possibly for this reason he stands his ground and only begins to leave after 856 appears to be preoccupied with a salmon. 856, in his hyper-dominant way, doesn\u2019t let 747 leave without more conflict. Just before the clip ends, 856 chases 747 into the vegetation behind the wildlife-viewing platform at the falls. Several people on the platform witnessed the rest of the confrontation. They reported that 856 and 747 continued to posture silently, and 747 continued to remain submissive to 856. 856 has also confronted and challenged other large males, like 755. Bears 856 and 755 scuffle at the falls, Katmai Brown Bears,19.25 28 June 2018 by Arlene Beach Dominant bears have many suvival advantages over subordinate bears.  Dominance may not provide access to more fish when salmon are extremely abundant, but dominance and a high rank would certainly provide access to the most productive fishing spots when salmon aren\u2019t as plentiful. When salmon are migrating at Brooks Falls, for example, some fish are almost always found in the jacuzzi, 856\u2019s most preferred fishing spot. Salmon aren\u2019t as consistently accessible in other locations like the lip or the far pool. At least one study, however, has found dominant bears don't necessarily catch more fish than bears lower in the hierarchy.  This indicates that bears utilize a variety of strategies to survive. Dominance is just one route to success. Bears like 856 take advantage of their size and strength to make their living, displacing other bears from productive fishing areas and potential mates. As 856 continues to challenge other bears over the next few weeks, more bears will take the hint and leave him alone or simply avoid him altogether. Soon, we may be watching the bearcam when the bears at the falls quit what they\u2019re doing. We might see them stand and begin to move away from their favorite fishing spot. Then we might observe 856 waltz toward Brooks Falls. By avoiding his approach, the other bears demonstrate a level of respect for an assertive survivalist, one uses size and aggression to get him what he wants.\" Park visitor, Mike Weagley, captured this July 2018 video of 603.  128 Grazer, 409 Beadnose (with fish), and 775 Lefty on the lip near to far at the beginning of this video.  409 takes her fish closer to the fish ladder to consume her fish.

At the 36:09 mark into the play-by-play 856 can be seen giving chase to 634 Popeye from the river below the falls, onto the bank in front of the viewing platform and then down towards the riffles.  Note: Video unavailable as of 2021.

(Note:  856 is seen returning up river closer to the falls at the 58:59 mark into the above play-by-play, 634 Popeye had returned earlier.)  We later learned that 856 killed one of 132's spring cubs near the Riffles wildlife viewing platform.  On July 4, 2018 at 06:20 Ranger Andrew popped into the bearcam comments to share the news of the July 3, 2018 incident: \"Hi everyone, last night near the Riffles we had a dramatic reminder that life as a bear can be difficult, dangerous, and short. Bear 856 came upon what is thought to be bear 132 and her two spring cubs. Bear 856 attacked and killed one of the cubs. After an altercation with 856, bear 132 then left the scene wounded. Her remaining cub was abandoned in a tree above the carcass of its deceased sibling . It could be heard vocalizing and crying out to its separated mother. The abandoned cub was later seen coming down from the tree, still vocalizing, and wandering around by itself. The whereabouts of both it and its mother are not known at this time. Though it can be tough to witness, infanticide is a natural part of the bear world. Both genders may kill cubs, it is most often committed by male bears. Mike Fitz and I will be doing a live chat later today on this topic at 9am Alaska time, 10am pacific. -Ranger Andrew\" 2018.07.05:  NWBearLove92 shared this 7/5/2018 photo of 856 on 5/28/2020. \"856 at the falls. I was trying not to make eye contact and hoping that he was looking at someone else on the platform. He looked very intimidating. 7/5/18.\"  2018.07.06: Death of Bear Cub at Brooks Falls ,  Explore blog by Mike FItz: \"As the smallest and most vulnerable of all bears, first year cubs (also called spring cubs or cubs-of-the-year) face significant risks and challenges, not the least of which are larger bears. On July 3, Katmai National Park ranger Andrew LaValle and I were hosting a live broadcast from Brooks Falls .  About 40 minutes into the broadcast, we watched Brooks River\u2019s most dominant bear, 856, chase another large male bear, 634 Popeye, downstream and out of our line of sight. Just a few minutes later and off camera, 856 encountered a mother bear and two spring cubs. He then attacked one of the cubs and killed it. The death is a powerful illustration of risk and danger in the bears\u2019 world. So focused on the waterfall in front of us, neither Andrew nor I saw or heard anything that even hinted at the event unfolding less than a hundred yards away, but a group of park visitors and employees witnessed the attack at the riffles platform, an elevated wildlife-viewing platform downstream of the falls. They saw 856 encounter 132 after he broke off his chase with 634 Popeye. 856 then saw the cub and attacked. 132 tried to defend her cubs but was overpowered by the much larger 856, who quickly returned to the injured cub and killed it. 132\u2019s other cub escaped up a spruce tree, where it remained for about two hours .   856\u2019s motivation in this instance isn\u2019t entirely clear. He didn\u2019t eat it, so hunger might not have played a strong role. Some biologists hypothesize that mate recognition influences the frequency of infanticide in certain species. Male bears may recognize former mates and kill cubs from unfamiliar females to reduce future competition for themselves and their kin. They may also be motivated to sire more offspring. Killing all cubs from a litter can cause a female bear to enter estrus and potentially be available to mate again. Importantly, the instinct to attack vulnerable animals, even if it leads to infanticide, might simply be a trait of many bears. In 2013, the bearcams captured footage of 402 defending her cubs from 813, an adult female, after 813 began to pursue one of 402\u2019s cubs as it fell over Brooks Falls. For the mother, the cub\u2019s death represents a significant loss. She\u2019s devoted considerable time and energy into caring for it, and 132 risked severe injury, even death, when she tried to defend her cub from 856. Mother bears seem to recognize the risk posed by other bears, which could be the main reason why many females avoid bringing their spring cubs near the falls. However, the possible reward of abundant salmon can be a powerful motivator for a mother who\u2019s trying to meet the nutritional demands of her cubs and satisfy her own insatiable hunger. Under the circumstances, the infanticide seemed to be a product of chance. Bears appear conditioned to attack vulnerable prey, even if it doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to a meal. 856, perhaps perceiving the cub\u2019s vulnerability, took advantage of a situation where the cub couldn\u2019t defend itself or flee. Bears also show no empathy for their prey. It\u2019s easy to see salmon suffering under the claws and teeth of hungry bears, such as when bears tear the skin off of living salmon.  These events certainly aren\u2019t committed under malice or cruelty, as bears live outside our morals, ethics, and the other values that help define our sense of right and wrong. When I left Brooks Falls at 10 p.m. on July 3, 132\u2019s remaining spring cub had just climbed out of its sanctuary in the spruce tree. It continued to bawl as it walked farther into the forest. As I departed, I caught a glimpse of 132 sniffing at the same tree where the cub found temporary safety. She then walked in the direction the cub had taken shortly before. Now, we know that 132 was reunited with her remaining cub . Brown bears live in a fierce and competitive world, and spring cubs are the most vulnerable of all bears. Through luck, skill, and the guidance of their mothers, cubs can grow into healthy independent bears. It\u2019s a risky and challenging world though, one in which cubs, their mothers, and the river\u2019s most dominant bears all compete to survive within.

Mike Fitz and Birgitt discussed 856 on Fat Tuesday, March 5, 2019 (snips of comments below).:Mike Fitz:  \"856 goes to show that you don't have to spend all your time eating to get fat. At the falls at least, he spends considerable more time displacing other bears and competing for access to females than most other males. Yet, he still gets very fat. Of course, you can't get that big without being good at fishing.\"Birgitt:  \"He was taking a break to chase 83 there. Do you have any sense of why he moved out of the J and to the far pool last year?\"Mike Fitz:  \"I don't know. He may have had a good reason, but I also suspect bears do things sometimes just because they want to, not because it gives them any sort of selective advantage. With that being said, fish may have been so plentiful last year that he didn't need as much access to the jacuzzi compared to other years. When there are fewer fish available, the j is one of the most consistently good fishing spots at the falls. When fish are super abundant though, it's not necessarily any more productive than several other places, including the far pool.\"Birgitt:  \"I was thinking something similar about the abundance of salmon, because neither 856 nor 747 spent much time in the J last summer. In fact, most of the big boars lined themselves up on the far side of the river. I started thinking of it as Boar Alley back there. Which, of course, gave 503 a lot of time in the J and gave the youngsters 812, 903 and 719 a chance to explore fishing in the J.But you're right. We should start thinking in terms of them doing things because they want to.\" \u200b\u200b\u200b Another Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum moment for 856 (credit to Goldi for the scary giant reference) as he chases 83 Wayne Brother then puts his nostrils to work.

One more 856 story: It was July 2019 (I think), around 6 p.m. I'd been volunteering on the Brooks Falls platform, and had stayed after my shift to watch the bears. The platform was unusually empty; it was the rare quiet hour between the daytime crowd and the nighttime crowd when most visitors had left to get dinner. So it was me and a younger couple on the platform, watching the bears. 856 and 747 were fishing at the falls, and there was a young female bear fishing in the riffles. 747 decided to go down to the riffles to say hello to the female. And suddenly, 856 decided he was interested in her, too. The poor female (I didn't recognize her, but she seemed very young) made a quick getaway. 747 decided to follow -- until 856 decided he wasn't happy about that, and started pursuing 747. From the Riffles, 747 (followed by 856) moved up toward the falls. Then the two boars marched toward the BF platform (where the couple and I stood watching, agape). They went up to our left, toward the fish ladder, then UP THE HILL behind the platform, so that they stood at eye level to us: 856 following 747, not running, but in deliberate pursuit, sending a message. Poor 747 moved behind the platform and into the woods on the right side of the platform (where BF low sometimes looks backward into the woods). We saw 747 emerge into the riffles, 856 still walking deliberately behind. They repeated their circle of the BF platform -- once again standing eye level to us, just a few yards away. I have never been so transfixed. Eventually, the two bears disappeared into the woods by the Riffles. At that point, the three of us started breathing again. We felt like we had witnessed the most incredible bear activity of the day -- and only the three of us had seen it. At the end of this, the couple needed to get back to the lodge for dinner -- but we were well aware that the two bears had disappeared into the woods near the riffles, and we really didn't want to encounter them on the Brooks Falls Trail! So we hung out for a little bit, giving the bears time to disperse, then walked back down the BF Trail together, talking loudly all the way so that the bears knew we were there. And guess what: We DID encounter a bear on the trail! But it was the female that they'd initially been interested in -- not the two males. An exciting -- and breathtaking -- display of dominance. We felt so privileged to have experienced this. On 2/21/2021 scooch replied to Stacey's story: \"Hi Stacey! That incident that you described may be part of these two gifs that I recorded on July 6, 2019. The first gif shows 747, right after he had exited the river by the BF platform, looking back to see if 856 was still following him, then moving on up the path.

Olatz also shared a story about these photos. \"856 was in the Jacuzzi, 854 Divot in the far pool, and 820 near Alice\u00b4s restaurant, when 747 - that had been taking a nap by the falls platform - entered the river the luminous, but thankfully not so hot evening of July 9th, 2019. The bear of colossal proportions, totally aware of the Boss\u00b4 presence in the river, walked around him crossing the island on his way to the conveyor belt. I was following him through the viewfinder of my camera when, all of a sudden, he stopped and his gaze was directed to the Jacuzzi. 856 had seen him and felt the urge to remind 747 who was in charge in Brook River that season. 856 approached 747 and they both exchanged some harsh words, until 856 felt the message had been clearly sent and received. Then, he turned around and walked away from 747 and toward the island. He cowboy-walked on it, scent-marked it and when his display of dominance was over, he moved again to the Jacuzzi. 747 sat in the river and stared at 856 all along, probably thinking one day it would be 856 the one that would yield to him. Little we knew that day was not so far away. Pictures taken during the evening of July 9th, 2019.\" Olatz Azcona Mun\u00e1rriz (aka Olatz) shared an additional 7/9/2019 photo of 856 on 2/12/2023.

Please request Bonnie Hankins' (aka NutsBoutBears) permission prior to using her photographs! 2021.06.28: On the morning of 6/28/2021, 856 was seen fishing at the falls. Not catching anything, he retired up the hill. He came back to the J a short time later and caught a fish. Instead of his usual routine of taking it to the island to eat he went up the fish ladder to consume it. That is when 747 showed up. Chatter FatBearChamp747 gives a verbal play-by-play below. FatBearChamp747 described their interpretation of the first interaction between 747 and 856. \"Went back and watched the 1st confrontation between 747 & 856 and it was even more amazing than the 2nd one - 856 Finally catches a salmon in they J - Yay the salmon are back! - but instead of eating it in the J or by the Island like he normally does, 856 climbed the ladder and went above the falls to eat his catch by 812's dinner rock - was the King of the Falls the last 10 years actually worried about getting his Salmon stolen? - then 747 climbs the ladder and approaches 856, he doesn't try to steal his fish buts puts on a full dominance display - with two tree markings above the Falls and one below by the viewing platform for good measure as he left (beginning to understand how 747 got those racing stripes on his back) maybe this is why 856 has been so anxious for the Salmon to come, he knows he is not as big as 747 is right now, maybe it won't last but at least for the moment it does look like there is a new sheriff in town.\" FatBearChamp's subsequent comment. \"OMG the crushing down of the tree as 747 approached 856 - lol - it's King Kong vs Godzilla and King Kong won the first two rounds - 747 was not intimidated by 856 even a little bit, maybe 747 will pay fir this insubordination later in the season but for now it sure does look like there has been a change at the top.\" Mike Fitz gave his interpretation of the events. \"That was quite an interesting confrontation between 747 and 856, two of the river's largest and most dominant bears. Initially, I couldn't tell if 747 approached 856 because he wanted some of 856's salmon or if 747 was just feeling strong enough to challenge 856 for dominance. Either way, 747 demonstrated some boldness by directly approaching 856 and marking trees in front of him. After 747 moved away, 856 reciprocated a bit and also marked some of the trees near the fish ladder. However, I would score that confrontation as a draw. No bear seemed to yield to the other and much of their behavior was obscured by vegetation. But about 10 minutes later, 747 directly approaches 856 below the falls. 856 yields upon 747's approach! Then 747 turns his back and walks away. Since this wasn't a conflict over a fishing spot then it's a clear indication that 747 \"won\" the interaction and at the moment can be considered more dominant. If we see 856 yield to 747 again, then we'll know there has been a shift in the hierarchy. For more than a decade, 747 has yielded to 856. That may have just changed.\" Blair-55 posted this gif of the 747 (left) and 856 (right) interaction. Mike Fitz commented about the two boars body language a short time later. after viewing Blair's gif. \"This captures the interaction well. 747: Head up, ears forward, direct approach--all signs of dominance. 856: Head slightly lowered, ears back, walking backwards while opponent approaches--all signs of submission.\" Hey Princess's 6/28/2021 video that captures both interactions. 856 and 747 confrontation display of dominance Explore.org 06.28.21 Video by Hey Princess GA Bear's 6/28/2021 video that captures the jacuzzi interaction.

They can access the most preferred fishing spots when they choose, easily appropriate food from other bears, and have a higher likelihood of courting female bears and siring offspring. Gaining access to food allows bears to grow larger. Growing larger gives bears a greater chance to become reproductively successful. 856 is a mature and large adult male who is frequently seen at Brooks Falls. He has his pick of fishing spots and is unchallenged when courting females. He\u2019s the most dominant bear seen along the Brooks River over the past few summers. But, how does a bear become dominant? What behavioral signs indicate a dominant bear? Traits of a dominant bear: 856 consistently demonstrates all of those physical characteristics and behaviors. In contrast, submissive or subordinate bears yield space and resources to 856 and bears like him. During an encounter, submissive bears also hold their head lower and position their ears back against their head. They are defensive and usually choose to avoid the approach of dominant bears. Dominance simply means having power and influence over others . Dominant bears influence the movement and behavior of other nearby bears, and while they can\u2019t command another bear to do anything they can use their size, strength, and power to force bears to yield or move away. 856 uses his size and disposition (he is more willing to assert himself around other bears) to gain access to the resources that he wants. Bears live in a competitive world where the biggest animals acquire and maintain greater access to the resources necessary to survive. In a bear\u2019s world, being dominant is yet another way to win the game of life. 856 courted and mated with 402 in 2010.  See above July 2011 information in Life History section for additional information.Brooks Camp's July 9, 2010 tweet re: 856 mated with 402 on the evening of July 8, 2010.  402 also mated with 218 Ugly the same evening.: 856 courted and mated with 94 in July 2011. 402 and 856 courted and mated again in 2012.

So if he has any, we don't know. Brothers are so rarely seen together at the falls as adults that we don't have many observations to say whether they'd be more tolerant of each other compared to unrelated bears. The only example I can think of is 83 and 868 who were suspected to be brothers from the same litter. 83 always seemed to be more dominant than 868 but they didn't interact much at the falls, although they would play fight in the lower river in late summer...\" 856 was successfully sampled in 2006 by former wildlife biologist Tamara Olson who obtained a hair sample.

Mckate shared these thoughts in the description of the video.: \"879 had a fear of swimming under the old bridge, so always got out and walked around. There was a lot of anticipation about how he'd receive this new bridge. I really expected him to walk all the way around the platforms, but he screwed up his courage and ran under. I hope it gets easier for him with time. 708 was also pretty freaked out the first time she saw the new bridge, but quickly became accustomed to it. Hang in there 879!\" 10 Sep 2019 879 Encounters New Bridge by mckate On September 12, 2019 at 12:59, Mike Fitz commented about 879 and his reaction to the new elevated bridge.: \"...To begin, I\u2019d like to give my interpretation of a situation many of you witnessed just a couple of days ago on the River Watch Cam.\" \"In the video, we see 879 approach the bridge at the river mouth, then turn around to snorkel upstream briefly. After emerging from the water on the far side of the river, he begins to approach the bridge, but 879 is clearly uncomfortable with the prospect of walking underneath it. After slinking slowly toward the bridge, he runs underneath it. Why might he have done this and what implications could this have for park managers and visitors? First, a little history on 879. He is a large, fully grown adult male who only has to contend with competition from other large adult males. His is also a bear who only uses Brooks River during late summer and fall. He\u2019s never been identified in June/July but presumably makes a good living elsewhere since he seems to arrive each year looking quite pudgy. I have watched 879 use the lower river area for many Septembers. Not once did I ever see him swim underneath the old floating bridge, even though it would have been quite easy for him to do so. Many other bears did it routinely. Instead, 879 always made the effort to get out of the water and walk around the bridge. Links to photos (#1 & #2 ) This indicates that human infrastructure can alter and interfere with the movements of bears and poses a challenge for both park managers and visitors. There are two main differences between the floating bridge and the newly constructed elevated bridge. The old floating bridge was a little over 100 yards long and had only one substantial elevated wildlife-viewing platform near its south side, but the new elevated bridge is about 1200 feet (400 yards) long, has several viewing areas, and creates a much larger visual footprint on the landscape. The other difference is movement of people. Movement on the floating bridge was restricted by park staff when bears were within 50 yards of it. Since bears and people are physically separated on the bridge now, park visitors are generally allowed to walk across the bridge at any time no matter the proximity of bears. Most bears who use the area near the bridge show moderate to high levels of habituation toward people. In other words, they show tolerance for our presence, noise, and activity. Bear 879 is a bit of an enigma in this sense. Around the bridge, he seems to display signs that\u2019s he\u2019s not consistently tolerant of people or our infrastructure even as he continues to use the lower Brooks River. How do you manage the area to protect such bears in a place like Brooks River wherepeople have the freedom to go nearly anywhere? It\u2019s extremely difficult. However, the NPS does do one important thing to help give bears greater access to the lower river in early fall\u2014the lodge closes on Sept. 18. This isn\u2019t because there isn\u2019t a demand from the public for rooms or because of the onset of cold weather (many lodges in the Katmai region operate into October). It is to reduce the number of people using the area so that bears can access the lower river more freely. Although Brooks Falls gets most of the attention from the public, the lower river is the most productive place for bears to fish in September and October. Over the last several years though, visitation in late summer and early fall has grown. Whereas before access to Brooks Camp after Sept. 18 required you to charter a plane, now a water taxi runs daily trips. The campground used to not accept reservations after Sept. 17, it\u2019s now available for online reservations through the end of October. After the lodge closed, park staff stopped managing the area near the floating bridge and the prevalence of bears made it difficult to cross in a timely manner without violating the park\u2019s wildlife distance regulation. With the elevated bridge, you can now walk across the river much more conveniently. All of this adds up to greater access for people. With that access, however, comes responsibility. Park rangers have an obligation to help visitors understand that bears are individuals, each with their own definition of personal space and comfort level around people. Visitors have an obligation to learn about how our presence influences bears. (If you visit, please pledge to behave in an ethical manner around bears.)Bearcam viewers can help by sharing the webcam experience with others, letting people know about the lives of bears as individuals, and the joys and challenges the bears experience in their lives. Perhaps 879 will get used to the bridge. Perhaps he won\u2019t and his instincts will force him to go around it. No matter his decision, bear 879 demonstrates that bears make choices, and their behavior around people is going to be specific to the individual bear and the circumstance.\" Katmai Conservancy Ranger Naomi replied to Mike Fitz at 13:04 on September 12. 2019 about 879's reaction to the new elevated bridge on September 10, 2019.: Casper Pike captured this video of 879 with 151 Walker on September 10, 2019.: 151 and 879 2019 09 10 12 20 47 724 by Casper Pike Lani H filmed this 9/10/2019 video of 151 Walker and 879 in the far pool. 879 Returns, 879 and 151 Walker in the far pool 9 10 2019, video by Lani H Park visitor Jack Healdcaptured a photo of 879 and 151 Walker in the far pool on the same date, 9/10/2019.

Ranger Mike Fitz answered this question on August 24, 2013 at 15:22.: \"There's a chance, but without DNA evidence, we wouldn't be able to confirm it It is rare for us to be able to consistently ID a bear from cub to subadult to adult. Even when we do, without DNA evidence we can't actually be sure of any bars siblings or parental lineage.\" There were no darting attempts, successful or unsuccessful, of 879 by Ranger Michael Saxton in 2016.

Soon afterwards, she was joined by another bear that I believe is her brother, 907. They greeted each other with a brief session of bitey face before 907 moved on, looking for a fish, which he soon caught. These two 4.5 year old subadults are believed to be the lovely 708 Amelia's 2015 male and female offspring.\". Mazey :noted the following about Scooch's 907 & 908 photographs that help in confidence with the ID of these two subadults.: \"You can see the clipped off looking left ear on 907 in photo #5 and of course 908 has her bra on\" (p 02/06/2020 05:18 ).

We had a storm here this weekend that challenged the best of us, with constant winds of 30 mph and gusts over 50 mph. I navigated that by staying in my cabin, out of the way of falling trees -- of which there were many. Most bears hid as well, since they navigate the world mostly through scent. They are guided by their powerful noses and when winds blow away any clues as to where other bears and/or threats might lurk, bears are much more cautious than usual. Bears secure in the hierarchical positions like 856 and 747 didn\u2019t seem to be bothered by the forceful winds, but bear 907, a younger bear, kept his nose in the air, stood frequently and was constantly on the alert for other bears whose scents were lost in the wind.

Terry Miller (aka sundogsNM) recorded 3 of the 5 share sessions.Sharing fish is not a common behavior among brown bears, especially a boar sharing with another boar. A healthy younger boar sharing with a frail aged adult boar has been previously documented at Brooks River one other time....16 Cinnamon in 2011, the final season 16 was observed using the Brooks River. A second observation of this rare brown bear behavior begs some questions, for example: Do brown bears sense things we have not even considered? Do brown bears have the capacity to take care of one another in a desperate time of need with regard to survival? One things these amazing creatures have taught us is that even after all this time, we still have much to learn.: Part 1 - 907 brings fish, 480 Otis protects his scrap, 907 checks it but leaves for more fishing.: 08 Aug 2023- 480 Otis and 907 share, part 1 (explore.org) video by Terry Miller (aka sundogsNM) Part 2 - 907 brings fish number 3, 480 Otis is full but picking at scraps.: 08 Aug 2023- 480 Otis and 970 share fish, part 2 (explore.org) video by Terry Miller (aka sundogsNM) Part 3 - 907 brings fish number 5, 480 Otis seems excited to see 907, but 480 mostly stares at the scraps while 907 eats.: 08 Aug 2023- 480 Otis and 970 share fish, part 3 (explore.org) video by Terry Miller (aka sundogsNM) Add here 468 family tree - updated Nov 2022 Mother:708 Amelia (Speculated) Father:Unknown Littermate:908 (Speculated) Maternal Grandmother:468 Reggie (Speculated) Maternal Sibling:284 \"Electra\" (Speculated), 708's 2008 litter Maternal Cousin: 901 (Speculated), 284's 2016 litter Cubs were not being sampled for the genetics study in 2015 by Ranger Michael Saxton Cubs were not being sampled for the genetics study in 2016by Ranger Michael Saxton Cubs were not being sampled for the genetics study in 2017by Ranger Michael Saxton There wereno known genetics study samples obtained of 907by Ranger Michael Saxton in 2018.
