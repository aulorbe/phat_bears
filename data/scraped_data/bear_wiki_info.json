[{"name": "032 Chunk", "bio": "32 Chunk July 2021 NPS photo Adult Male Year First Identified: 2007 as a subadult male, has since reach adulthood Year Last Observed: 2023 Known Offspring Of: Not known at this time Genetics Study Samples Obtained: 32 Chunk was successfully darted by Ranger Michael Saxton in October 2017 for the genetics study. In 2012, 32 Chunk was identified as a young, medium sized male. His coat was medium brown and had darker spots around his neck and shoulders. A scar above his right eye, as well as his large hindquarters were distinctive features at that time. In 2014 and 2015, 32 Chunk was described as a young, medium-large male. In early summer, his coat was medium --brown, and he would shed the fur on his shoulders first. 32 often had numerous small scars and wounds around his neck and face. In the fall, his coat was uniform medium to dark brown. In all seasons, he appeared to carry more weight in his hind quarters than in front which gave 32 a distinctive silhouette. He lacked a prominent shoulder hump. In 2016, 32 Chunk was described as a large adult male. In early summer, his coat is medium-brown and he sheds the fur on his shoulders first. He has numerous small scars and wounds around his neck and face. His ears are distinctly pointed, and he has a prominent brow. In the fall, his coat is a uniform medium to dark brown. In all seasons, he appears to carry more weight in his hind quarters than in front which gives 32 a distinctive silhouette. He lacks a prominent shoulder hump. Resident Naturalist with Explore, Mike Fitz created this Meet Bear 32 Chunk video Can a brown bear be dominant, patient, and even playful at the same time? For at least one adult male at Brooks River, the answer is yes. Chunk is a large adult male with narrowly-set eyes and a prominent brow ridge. Even at his leanest, Chunk carries substantial fat reserves, especially on his hind quarters. He tends to shed much of the fur around his shoulders and neck. This gives him a two-toned appearance and exposes numerous scars and wounds.: Meet Bear 32 Chunk - Bears of Brooks Falls by Explore's Resident Naturalist Mike Fitz In 2012, 32 Chunk remained subordinate to most other bears, and was often begging or scavenging fish scraps. When fishing, he would often stand up to get a better view. He had been observed fishing the falls and the lower river. 32 was one of the few bears in the Brooks Camp area during June 2012, so he was an early season bear even back then. In 2014, it was noted that 32 Chunk had become increasingly dominant along the river, behavior that continued into 2017. In 2014 and 2015, he was subordinate to only the largest adult males at Brooks Falls (ex: 856, 747, 814 Lurch). 32 was still observed sometimes attempting to steal fish from other bears. From 2014 through 2017, 32 continued to fish the falls and the lower river. At Brooks Falls, he usually fished the far pool, but would sometimes fish the jacuzzi when other more dominant bears are not present. When fishing, he still often stood up to get a better view. 32 Chunk continued to be an early season arriver, sometimes seen in the Brooks River area in May and June. The 2015 Bears of Brooks River Book says to look for 32 to become increasingly dominant as he grows over the next few years. In 2021, #32 continued to be one of the most dominant bears on the river. Despite this, it is not uncommon to also see him patiently wait to scavenge leftovers. He returned in July with a large gash across his muzzle. While we do not know how he got this scar, many large males often accrue scars as a result of vying for mating opportunities. 2007: 32 Chunk was first identified as a subadult in 2007, but has since reached adulthood. 2007.07.01: Ranger Jeanne's 07/01/2007 photo of 32 Chunk on her flickr page. 2008.07.25.

This play fight last for nearly 20 minutes. Young, well fed bears that are tolerant of one another will often play flight. This play mimics the motions of real fighting between bears. These young males are ascending the bear hierarchy each summer. It is quite possible that they will be fighting for real over fish or females in the next few years. KNP&P video: 32 Chunk and 89 Backpack play fight 09 12 2014 video by KNP&P Cam viewer and KNP volunteer Stacey commented on KNP's video of 32 Chunk and 89 Backpack playing on 3/14/2021. \"Happy 32 Chunk Day! When I started watching the cams, in 2013, the first bear I fell in love with was 89 Backpack. And, at the time, 89's BFF was 32 Chunk! The two bears were similar in age and size -- and (although it's hard to believe now) they were very similar in temperament. The first few years I watched, it seemed that 89 and 32 were ALWAYS playfighting. ALWAYS! It was like they never ate -- they just wanted to playfight. And unlike 503 Cubadult, they weren't playing with everyone -- in my mind, they only playfought with each other. We'd frequently see them playfighting on the BF cam. But I remember vividly the first time I saw this video, which someone (maybe Mike Fitz or Ranger Jeanne?) recorded from the LR platform. The first time I watched it, I kept hitting the audio button -- because it seemed like someone had hit \"mute.\" I couldn't believe that 2,000 pounds of bear could interact with each other so completely silently. And now, whenever I see bears playfighting, I think of how silent those playfights are. Over the years, 89 Backpack and 32 Chunk have grown into quite different bears. 89 Backpack is a lover, not a fighter; while 32 Chunk has dreams (at least sometimes) of wearing the crown. I'm so glad I met 32 Chunk in his \"early\" days, when he was palling around w/89.\" 9/12/2014 video by JoeBear and comment by him, \"Backpack and Chunk wrestling in a video taken by Katmai National Park Rangers.

The 32 Chunk & 474 Fight from the Riffles Cam 2017-09-09, video by Birgitt 19:46:Mike Fitz comments about the fight between 474 and 32 Chunk: \"These events provide another opportunity for us to contemplate competition and toughness of brown bears. The hierarchy on the river has shuffled again with more large adult males using the falls at the same time. I visited Brooks Camp earlier this week and was able to see 747, 474, and 32 Chunk. When I was at the river, these bears were usually separated in time and space. I didn\u2019t see them commingle much at all, except for one interaction between 747 and 474 where 474 appeared to avoid the approach of 747. Based on that and videos of 32, 4747, and 747 from the bearcams, here\u2019s the hierarchy as I currently see it:747 > 474 > 32 68 is also very large and quite capable of maintaining access to fishing spots along with the largest adult males. However, I did not witness him interacting with 32, 474, or 747 so I am unsure where he sits in the hierarchy. It\u2019s reasonable to assume, based on his size alone, that he ranks at least as high as 32. 474 \u201cwon\u201d the fight with 32 from my perspective. 32 appeared to encroach on 474\u2019s space, even lunging toward 474. Instead of yielding, 474 decided to physically engage 32 and he quickly gained the advantage, biting into 32\u2019s shoulder hump. 474 then disengaged, slowly moving away to fish, while 32 sat still and watched him. Fights like this remind me of the toughness of bears. If a human were in 32\u2019s place, he or she may have likely received life threatening injuries, but 32 Chunk just walked away. In fact, he seemed to show no outward signs of injury when he walked under the cam afterward.See LaniH's snapshot here Intense fights among bears at Brooks Falls are relatively rare in early summer and even more so in late summer and fall when salmon can be scavenged throughout the lower half of Brooks River. This year silver (coho) salmon appear to be more abundant than average (nearly every salmon I saw bears catch at the falls was a silver salmon). Silver salmon are usually larger than the more abundant sockeye salmon and their run is later in the summer so right now they are probably richer in calories than the sockeyes who have spent weeks in fresh water without eating. Fishing at the falls now may give bears even more opportunities to get fat. As we\u2019ve witnessed, fishing in close proximity to your competitors though is risky. 32 Chunk\u2019s reign at the very top of the hierarchy was short lived. However, he remains a very large adult male, one of the fattest on the river. While he seem to have free reign in July and August, he now faces stiffer and more challenging competitors this fall.\" When Mike Fitz was asked: \"How often during your time at Brooks did you see another adult male like Otis approach two equally large males that were fighting?\" Mike's reply: \"It's not a common sighting, but in the video of the fight Otis wasn't the only bear to approach. The other bears near the far pool--503, 68--approached the fight as well. I don't have a good explanation for this behavior. Perhaps it was curiosity or they sensed one or both bears could be vulnerable to getting displaced if they approached. I'm not sure.\" Mike Fitz was asked: \"Thanks Mike what are your thoughts on Otis reaction to the fight near him?\" Mike's reply: \"I'm not sure why Otis approached, but I don't think it was to referee or otherwise intervene. 68 and 503 also moved close to the fight. Maybe they were curious and defensive at the same time?\" Cam viewer and park visitor, Cheri's Random Currents blog about the 474 and 32 Chunk fight, On March 9, 2018 Cheri also shared these September 2017 photos of 474: Photo #1 and Photo #2 Flyer 7474's 9/9/2017 video of 32 Chunk moving downstream after the fight with 474. 32 After the Encounter With 474 2017-09-09 Video by flyer 7474 Also on 9/9/2017, 32 Chunk is fishing in the jacuzzi when he is displaced by 747, video by Brenda D. 747 walks to and marks the island while 480 Otis observes him. 32 Chunk is now back in the jacuzzi and 747 has moved over near the far pool.

A 32 Chunk story: One evening in 2018, I was standing on the BF platform with a law enforcement ranger who was very familiar with the bears. A large bear came down the path by the nanny tree; and as this bear arrived at BF, a lot of younger, smaller bears dispersed. \"Is that 856?\" said the ranger, noting the way all the other bears took off. \"I *think* it's 32 Chunk,\" I said, \"with his perpetually worried look.\" The LE ranger looked at me in surprise -- and then he looked at 32's face. \"That's funny!\" he said. \"I never noticed before -- but he DOES look worried!\" It made me realize that watching the bears on the cams is sometimes very different than watching them in person. On the cams, we can see closeups of the bears' faces, and ears, and scars and stuff. . But if you're watching in person, you don't get that view. So here's to 32 Chunk, and his perpetually worried look! 2018.07.11: The Return of 32 Chunk video by Melissa Freels: The Return of 32 Chunk, July 11, 2018 by Melissa Freels 32 Chunk and 856 dominance display during play-by-play video by Lani H.: 856 and 32 Chunk dominance displays during PBP 7 11 2018 appx 7 45pm AK by Lani H 2018.07.19: 32 Chunk video by Brenda D.

Scooch shared this information about observing 32 Chunk and 68.: \"On that lovely autumn morning our attention was focused on Otis, the beloved idol of Brooks River, as he floated in the J, patiently waiting for scraps from 151 Walker, the lip fishing phenom, to wash over the falls. While engrossed in that view we heard someone mention that there was a huge bear at the far end of the island. We turned to see32 Chunkstanding there, in all his glory. He WAS huge, with rolls of fat on his chest and top of his legs, his front paws pointed inward under the strain of his weight. His thick coat was dry, revealing textured and curly fur that is not easily evident when viewed on the explore cams. He bent over to intently smell the area around a recently dug belly hole, then slowly walked to the other end of the island. He sat down and observed the activities of the few bears that were present before deciding to make his way across the river. To our surprise, he displaced 68 from the office, without even a grumble or hint of protest from 68. Even the expression on Chunk's face looked perplexed at how easy it was.\" Scooch also captured this photograph of 32 Chunk on September 16, 2019 (p 02/25/2020 01:22 ).: Please request Scooch'spermissionprior to using her photographs! 474 (closest) and 32 Chunk (farthest) can be seen peacefully fishing in the far pool in this 9/16/2019 video by Lani H. 474 and 32 Chunk in the far pool 9 16 2019, video by Lani H 2019.09.23:Mckate captured a video titled \"This is 32 Chunk\" on 9/23/2019. 23 Sep 2019 This is 32 Chunk, video by mckate 2019.09.26: 32 Chunk swats fish out of 503 Cubadult's mouth but loses it video by Lani H.: 32 Chunk swats fish out of 503's mouth but loses it 9 26 2019 by Lani H 2019.10.04: 32 Chunk and 503 Cubadult play fightingvideo (part 1) by Lani H.: 503 and 32 Chunk play fighting part 1 10 4 2019 by Lani H Mckate also captured video  of 32 and 503 playing on 10/4/2019. 4 Oct 2019 503 Plays 32 Out of the J, video by mckate 2019.10.05: 32 Chunk (left) and 503 (right) can be seen playing at Brooks Falls on 10/5/2019, video  by mckate.

Can anybody identify who this is?? I thought it was \"chunk\" but I am not sure.#2Actually, I think that the picture caused the huff.. When I saw him he was staring at me. So I slowly raised my camera. When the camera covered my face, he started huffing. I think that covering my face and hiding my eyes was not a good idea.#3This is something that I did not realize until I did it. If the bear is far away, its of no consequence. But if the bear is close, I would not hide my face/eyes with a camera.#4No. I was not on a platform at the time. There was not a platform in that area. When this occurred, I slowly, but purposefully headed to the closest one.#5I was told to stay at least 50 yards away..... But the bears would often come much closer. In the three days that I was there I had several come closer.#6I was alone at the time and it was very intimidating. Please request Mark Kostich's permission prior to using his photos!

Meet 128 Grazer - Bears of Brooks Falls, video by Explore Live Nature Cams 128 Grazer uses Brooks River in July and the fall, but like most females she typlically cannot compete with male bears for prime fishing spots. Recently, 128 has become one of the most skilled bears to fish the lip of Brooks Falls. In the fall, she will fish the lower river area, cut bank, and riffles. 128 is another bear who has learned to associate people with fish. This is a behavior shared with other bears like 438 Flo and 854 Divot. She is relatively habituated to people and will rapidly approach anglers who have a fish on the line. Anglers should give 128 extra space in the river and stop fishing well before she is within 50 yards. 128 Grazer is believed to be the 2005 offspring of 408 CC (Crooked Claw). 128 was part of a litter of three cubs that 408 kept for three summers from 2005 to 2007. In early July 2016 128 Grazer returned to Brooks River with three spring cubs, her 1st known litter. She was seen throughout the summer fishing the riffles, cut bank and falls. While fishing the falls, 128 initially avoided fishing the lip, instead opting to \"dash and grab\" around the area closest to the falls platform. Later in July, 128 began to occasionally fish the lip, but remained wary of other bears in proximity to her cubs. 128 proved to be remarkably protective of her first litter. She was seen chasing off and attacking several other females and dominant males who approached too closely, including 83 Wayne Brother, 402, 409 Beadnose, and 32 Chunk. Her aggressively protective approach appears to have paid off ~ 128 was last seen in fall of 2016 with all three of her spring cubs, looking healthy and well fed. 128 returned to the Brooks River on June 6, 2017 with all three offspring from her 1st litter, now yearlings. 128 Grazer is believed to be one of three 2005 offspring from 408 CC's (aka Crooked Claw) first known litter. 408 CC was very attentive to these 3 cubs and occasionally charged other bears that were simply walking by. 128 Grazer exhibitedthis same behavior with her first litter of cubs in 2016.408 CC kept this litter of cubs through their 3rd summer, emancipating them at age 3.5. 2005.??.??:  This 2005 iStock photo by jcrader is believed to be 408 CC and her 3 spring cubs. 128 Grazer is believed to be the spring cub in the middle.

She was seen throughout the summer fishing the riffles, cut bank and falls. While fishing the falls, 128 initially avoided fishing the lip, instead opting to \u201cdash and grab\u201d around the area closest to the falls platform. Later in July, 128 began to occasionally fish the lip, but remained wary of other bears in proximity to her cubs. 128 proved to be remarkably protective of her first litter. She was seen chasing off and attacking several other females and dominant males who approached too closely, including 83, 402, 409, and 32. Cam viewers affectionately referred to this 128 Grazer behavior as \"bear (insert bear number) got Grazered'. 408 CC, 128's mother, displayed the same hyperprotective behavior when raising 128 Grazer and her two littermates. 2016.??.??:In April of 2017, KNP&P Interpretive Ranger Kristen talkedabout 128 Grazer in a KNP&P video that sharessome 2016 footage of the 128 family group, including 128's interaction with 83 Wayne Brother (note: not 747).: Ranger Kristen talks 128 Grazer 2016.??.??: Xander-Sage shared these 2016 season snapshots (#1 , #2 , #3 , #4 & #5 )of 128 Grazer and her 3 spring cubs.

Grazer is determinedly digging along the bank while the cubbies spend six minutes playing. Almost all of it is Fifi playing with 903 while dark cub rests by mama. 903 is somewhere between 2 or 3 times the size of Fifi but it doesn't slow her down any.In case you're wondering what Grazer is digging for, you can faintly hear a Ranger talk about it, and it sounds like she was digging looking for small burrowing mammals.

Theresa commented \"One more group of pics promised on the book club meeting. Here is what \"Being Grazered\" looks like. It was pretty terrifying because it happened so fast and he just came unsuspectingly down the trail. He is so much larger than her and could have easily probably killed her or seriously injured her, at least. Afterwards she sat at the base of the tree her cubs were in still huffing & jaw-popping. It is pretty amazing to hear. She had a couple of puncture wounds on her face and a gash on her chest - 2 pics of little Peanut trying to make mom feel better a couple hours later when they took a nap right by the treehouse.

Her physique showed the lack of balance between the two needs. Even by mid July, 128 looked as thin as a lean spring bear. It is normal for sows with cubs to be skinnier than they are without cubs. Caring for cubs means less time fishing, and the calories gained by fish that are caught are \u201cshared\u201d among the family. Slowly but surely, Grazeradapted her behavior to compensate.Through the month of July, 128 Grazerhas demonstrated how balancing those conflicting needs is, like many things in the bear world, a learning process. 128\u2019s three spring cubs are her first litter. Soon after arriving to the Brooks River, she fiercely defended her cubs when 83 \u201cWayne Brother\u201d approached too close to the family group on his way to the falls. Just a few days later, 128 also charged 402, chasing her away from the river. Both of the bears 128 drove off are much larger than her. Throughout the middle of July, we watched 128 inch closer and closer to the falls. She became less stressed by the presence of other bears, allowing large males like 480 to approach within a dozen yards or closer. She spent less time looking over her shoulder and more time with her eyes trained on the schools of salmon in front of her. Towards the end of July, 128 even got up onto the lip, sometimes treeing her cubs while she fished. Still, Grazerremained vigilant.As are all bears, Grazerand her cubs were often at great risk by fishing at the falls. Late in July, 128 again needed to defend her cubs aggressively, this time against the largest bear on the river, 747. A few days later, her cubs were swept over the falls (August 6, 2016 video by Brenda D - unavailable as of 2021),sending Grazerinto a frenzied panic. In each brush with danger, 128 successfully protected her cubs.So far, Grazerseems to be winning in the \u201crisk vs. reward\u201d game of survival. As a result of her adapted behavior, \u201cGrazer\u201d has put on more weight. Her cubs have too. If and when we see \u201cGrazer\u201d again in the fall, there is no guarantee she will have all, or any, of her cubs with her. But whether she raises her cubs to be weaned or not, 128 is on her way to being a successful bear. As the season continues, we all hope to watch as she continues to balance the demands of her own survival against those of her cubs. In July 2016 park visitor, Jenny of Zealandia Designs, captured this video of 128 Grazer and her 3 spring cubs treeing themselves. Jenny also wrote a blog: Katmai Bears 2016, The Year of the Cubs where you can ready about her trip and see additional photos:: Brown Bears Do Climb Trees by Zealandia Designs 2016.07.??:   Laura Lyn Photography captured multiple July 2016 photos of 128 Grazer and her 3 spring cubs, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22 and #23.

When 128 is near the falls, her cubs often react to the movements of other bears by fleeing to the base of tree and frequently climb up it. 128 also seems to be quite defensive, more so than most other females with cubs at Brooks River. We\u2019ve witnessed her charging and sometimes attacking male bears who approach her too closely, including larger males like 83 and 747. We know that other bears pose a threat to her cubs, so why would a bear take her cubs to Brooks Falls? This is 128's first known litter. Motherhood is a new experience and challenge for her. It is not uncommon for bears with cubs to alter their behavior to give their cubs a greater chance of survival. 128, like 409 Beadnose, frequently fished on 2 of the 3 Spring Cubs of 128 Grazer Ranger Mike Fitz posted July 4, 2016 at 11:19  the lip of Brooks Falls last year when neither had any cubs. So far this year, we haven\u2019t seen either bear visit the lip. While 128 has made her way to the falls, 409 has completely avoided the area as far as I know. In contrast, 402 fishes at Brooks Falls regardless of her cubs\u2019 age. If you take your cubs to Brooks Falls, the reward in food can be exceptionally high, but the close proximity of other bears increases risk to cubs. If you avoid the falls in early July, then rich food sources like salmon are harder to find, but your cubs may face less threats from other bears. Each bear actively weighs risk versus reward when searching for food and raising offspring. This is especially conspicuous when we follow the stories of mother bears and the challenges they face.\" 2016.07.06: Park visitor and cam viewer, PhotobearsBry, captured a video of 128 Grazer and her 3 spring cubs.

This is well past my work day but as I was headed to the lodge around 7pm, there was 128 Grazer and her two cubs on the beach. I have a ton of photos of them, but here are a few of them as they passed by my cabin. They were very playful. I've been following them for the past couple of hours. They are still resting on the beach right now. But I couldn't wait to let you know because I realize that you will be as excited as I am. She (128 Grazer) was extraordinarily playful this evening. A little cautious, her first time in camp but played with her cubs a lot. One (cub) is clearly much smaller than the other. It is late and I can't get to sleep I am so excited about the experience with 128 this evening. It is incredible that one can't see her scar. It was so deep. The resiliency of bears always amazes me.

It was very difficult to see in real time. Explore Resident Naturalist Mike Fitz did a live chat to share his view of what had transpired between the subadult and 128 Grazer, video by Explore. Warning: Graphic and difficult to watch.  Mike Fitz went through the video explaining both the young bear and 128 Grazer's behavior. A summary of Mike's comments: \"The young bear was 2.5 maybe 3.5 years old, possibly recently emancipated and very hungry. It had earlier successfully reached up and stolen a fish from 128 Grazer. It was rewarded for the risk that it took. The subadult came back after consuming its fish off camera. It can be seen reaching up repeatedly. Grazer warned it several times by swatting at it. 128 Grazer's yearlings were stealing fish from mom. They were also very hungry. Grazer is stressed out and disciplines her own cub. The young subadult reaches up to attempt to grab fish. It gets close to Grazer's yearling.  For lack of a better word, 128 Grazer grabs the sub and is mauling it. During the violent interaction, other bears go about their business. Was the young bear injured? It probably felt pain but did not appear to have any apparent wounds. 128 Grazer appeared to grab it by the loose skin around its neck which probably prevented damage to tissue. The bear was in a vulnerable position but got a little bit lucky that Grazer wasn't able to grab any of the deep tissue. The young bear has been seen back at the falls. It hasn't approached 128 Grazer to try any of the same tactics. It is still quite bold maybe even fishing the lip of the waterfall.  This situation really did demonstrate the risk that young bears are willing to take to satisfy their hunger. It's a tough life being a young bear. You're separated from mom, you're at the bottom of the bear hierarchy. You've got to face a lot of competition in order to gain access to the salmon that will sustain you and help you gain the fat reserves necessary to survive winter hibernation.\" Grazer Attacks Small Bear - Bear Cam Break Down (Warning Graphic) Video by Explore Flyer 4477 also captured 7/19/2021 video of the event.

Outside my cabin in Valley Road housing, I saw a very light colored bear that looked like a subadult to me. Then came another bear, then another. It was Grazer and her two cubs coming from Lake Brooks, a place they frequent. They look terrific. Very exciting. The question: Will 128 emancipate her cubs in their 4th season?

However, like all bears his age, he is regularly displaced by more dominant bears at their preferred fishing locations. 2017 Bears of Brooks River book: 151 is a young adult male who will regularly visit Brooks Falls in July and fishes at the cut bank and lower Brooks River in the fall. As a young adult, 151 is sometimes displaced from his preferred fishing spots. However, he has grown significantly in recent years. During 2016 he was displaced less often and was seen displaying dominance over other, younger bears more often than in previous years. 151 is a particularly playful bear. He has been observed playing extensively with #503, #289, #32, and others. Bears hone survival skills by engaging in play. Play-fighting can improve the strength, speed, coordination, and muscle-memory needed during real fights for survival with other bears. 151 Walker was a spring cub with 818 (mother) and 152 littermate. 2008.07.25: Could this be 151 Walker as a yearling with 818 and 152 in this photo by Jim Chagares?

Young adults, like 151, are consistently challenged by older, larger, and more dominant bears. This is a fact of life in the bear world. The most dominant bears are the least likely to yield space or food while less dominant, younger bears are the most likely to yield. The hierarchy of bears at Brooks River changes every year, however. 151 may not be very dominant now, but neither was 747 or 856 (two of Brooks River\u2019s most dominant bears) at his age.

Both images were taken near the Riffles platform. In the 1st image, the male makes eye contact with me and gives me a huff from across the river. Later, he is mating with an unknown female. Any ideas who this muscular male is?? Thanks in advance for any help!! I am often asked, what is the biggest difference between watching the cams, and seeing the bears in person; besides the obvious answer of just being there. I would say that without a doubt, the biggest difference is that when you are there, the bear often watch you, and sometimes take an interest in what you are doing.\" Please request Mark Kostich's permission prior to using his photos!

Here are a couple of quick 151 stories. 1) 151 Walker was the first bear I saw in Brooks River. It was late June, so there weren't a lot of guests in the park -- and there weren't a lot of bears, either! I went out to the Riffles Platform around 8 a.m. I was the only one there -- and there was just one bear in the river. My first thought: \"That's a really big bear!\" My second thought -- based on the ringed eyes, the Mickey Mouse ears, and the location in the Riffles: \"That's 151 Walker!\" When I see 151 on the cams, I always think of him as a smaller bear -- because next to 480, or 747, or some of the other big males at the falls, he looks kind of junior. But when I saw him sitting there in the water -- the first bear I'd seen in the river -- he really has SUBSTANCE to him. 2) Early in July, on a very crowded day, I was working at the Falls platform. One of the bigger bears -- 856, maybe, or 747, had been courting 128 for a LONG time. She was NOT INTERESTED, and so she treed herself high up in a tall tree behind the BF platform. When she came down, she walked down to the Riffles, and soon after went into the woods w/151 Walker. He does have a way w/the ladies! 3) We saw 151 Walker in the river a lot. Once, I was talking w/a guest about 151, and I said, \"He's quite popular with the ladies.\" \"Do you mean with humans?\" she said. \"Or with bears?\" \"Both,\" I replied.... And those are my stories of 151 Walker, an amiable, omnipresent bear..\" 2018.06.??: Park visitor and cam viewer,Melissa Freels sharedthese June 2016 photos of 151 Walker and 708 Amelia:#1 708 Amelia following 151 Walker on Valley Road&#2 151 Walker following 708 Amelia on Valley Road.: Please request Melissa'spermissionprior to using her photos! 2018.06.??:Lesleezee sharedthisphotoof 708 Amelia and 151 Walker by the walkway near the tree house in June 2018 at Brooks falls. 151 came up to the falls with 719 and left with 708!

I had watched 409 so much earlier this summer that I started to see her everywhere. I looked at your photographs from this morning, and mine, and y\u2019all were right, that was 708 with 151 this morning.\" Ranger Russ also shared these 4 photographs of 151 Walker and 708 Amelia from this morning. Photo #1 , #2 , #3 , & #4 .: Volunteer-in-park, Stacey shared her 151 Walker & 708 Amelia story (p 02/09/2020 05:37 ).: \"Here is a 708 Amelia story (kind of): It was late June 2018, my second day (I think) volunteering at Brooks Camp. I was receiving an informal orientation before my actual volunteer service began, and I was with a group of people, including a ranger, standing at the Corner, on the Brooks Lodge side of the bridge. KNPP had the floating bridge at that time, and the bridge was closed, because the two bears above -- 151 Walker and 708 Amelia -- were canoodling near the LR platform. Viewers on the LR platform were transfixed -- we could see lots of cameras pointed at the two lovebirds. But we couldn't see the encounter itself. On our side of the bridge, we waited patiently for the bear jam to end, and gazed across the river, trying to catch a glimpse of the two adorable canoodlers. Suddenly, just a few feet behind me, I heard a loud \"huff.\" And at the same time, the ranger's radio crackled, \"Corner!\" The ranger on the LR platform was radio-ing because they'd spotted a bear at the Corner -- just as the bear arrived and huffed loudly to announce its presence. I looked over my shoulder, and there the bear was -- maybe 3-5 feet away from me and the human group. This was my first real encounter with a bear, and the ranger we were with was excellent. \"Okay,\" he said calmly, \"I want you all to move behind me.\" We shuffled smoothly and quickly away from the bear and behind the ranger. \"And now we're going to move away from the bear,\" he said, and moved us 50 yards down the campground trail, away from Corner, and toward the lodge. The bear followed, about 25 yards behind the group. \"So now we're going to step off the trail,\" the ranger said, calmly reminding us of the instructions we'd learned in bear orientation. We moved off the trail, and the bear walked past. \"I know you all think this is a good time for cell phone pictures,\" the ranger said, \"but it's really not.\" The visitors smiled sheepishly and pocketed their phones. I've always wondered who the bear was! Was it 708 Amelia, who may have swum across the river after her romantic encounter w/151 Walker? Or was it another bear, who either swam across the river or who came up through the trees between Corner and the Point? I'll likely never know. But I've always been so impressed w/the ranger's calm, by-the-book handling of the situation, which I've tried to use as a model ever since. And that's my story of 708 Amelia -- or really, the story of what was happening on the other side of the bridge at the same time that 708 and 151 were canoodling at LR.\" 2018.07.??: Park visitor, Mike Weagley captured this July 2018videothat includes:171 sitting on the log at 0:41, 151 Walker at 0:55, 854 Divot at 1:02, and 504 at2:02.

This 9/5/2020 video by Cam Op Aspire (kwaahu) is quite interesting. 151 Walker gets a little rough with play. CamOp Aspire commented \"151 Walker had gotten many lessons in discipline from 128 Grazer, and 747 this season.  He'd tried asserting himself over some subadults who were minding their own business, which wound up getting him into a bit of trouble.  Here, 812, a younger Bear who still has the gift of play and that openness that the young possess, entices 151 to play with him.  After the first entreaties, to which Walker was receptive, he bursts into an aggressive move and grabs 812's cheek in his jaws.  He holds on for quite a long time, leaning in close to 812's ear.  I could almost hear him say, \"listen carefully:  I am playing with you now, but I want to be VERY CLEAR that this does not mean we are equals.  Don't challenge me or my authority.\"  During this time, 812 was totally still, not pulling away, not fighting back.  He listened carefully.  After 151 let him go, 812 submissively, almost childlike, was trying to engage him in more play, which he did, to some extent. It's a touching and sad display of how the playfulness is leaving 151.   Perhaps he has lost his innocence as well as he's grown older, getting caught up in \"grown up\" things.  Let's hope that 812 holds onto his for as long as possible.\" The play's the thing, but 151 needed to assert himself, too 05 09 20 Video by CamOp Aspire (kwaahu) 2020.09.06:  Mckate's 9/6/2020 video of 151 Walker launching a sneak attack on 820. \"Some day he is going to regret having picked on these large young bears.\" 6 Sep 2020- 151 Launches Sneak Attack on 820 Video by mckate 2020.09.07:  151 Walker and 820 play, 9/7/2020 video by Lani H. 151 Walker and 820 play 9-7-2020 Video by Lani H 2020.09.08:  Lani H 9/8/2020 video of 151 Walker sitting above the falls. 151 Walker sitting above the falls 9-8-2020 Video by Lani H 2020.09.09:  747 moves 151 Walker and 820 out of the office, 856 breaks up 747 having words with 820, 9/9/2020 video by Lani H. 747 moves 151 Walker and 820 out of the office, 856 breaks up 747 having words with 820 9-9-2020 Video by Lani H 2020.09.10: Cam viewer and park visitor 907AKSnow capturedvideoof 719 and 151 Walker on 9/10/2020. 719 confronts 151 Walker to warn him to not approach her cubs who are behind her at the island. 719-Princess has a few words with 151-Walker.

I head that way, staying safely behind Ranger Nick. And there they were. They had already mated, but the large male was standing, rubbing against a tree, leaving his mark. The female then left, coming towards us and moving down Park Avenue, where our cabins are. Ranger Nick and I then backed away because we knew that the male would soon follow his infatuation. He followed her, passing us within a few yards and coming within feet of Ranger Rylee standing in front of her cabin. Just another day in Brooks Camp. Now, you tell me who this amorous boar is. (we know, but aren't telling).\" Ranger Naomi shared 2 photos of the amorous boar, #1 and #2. Ranger Naomi later commented \"Well, it looks like we have a lot of very smart bear cam lovers here.

Did you notice how the smaller yearling in that litter behaves differently than it\u2019s larger siblings? The larger yearlings seem to more actively pursue their mother and take fish from her. She will nurse them, but mother bears won\u2019t bring food to their cubs. The cubs have to compete with one another for access to other food sources, like the fish that 409 catches. In most instances, it seems like the larger cubs (one of which is probably a male) are willing to pursue mom to get fish while the smaller cub won\u2019t. This is an example of how bears are individuals, even at a young age. As they grow, differences in disposition may even become more obvious.\" 2013.08.31: Juergen created these gifs (#1 & #2 ) of 409 Beadnose's three yearlings near the lower river wildlife viewing platform.: 2013.09.05: KNP&P's September 5, 2013 16:37 Facebook post: \"409 and her yearlings are back!

I'm not sure what it might be other than scars and swellings caused by biting insects. A bear's eyelids seem to be quite vulnerable to insect bites. I once watched 409 and 634 copulating near the falls platform and through my binoculars I could see their eyes swarmed by black flies while they were preoccupied. Sometimes the skin on moose can be eaten nearly raw by flies in summer as explained in this article.I've never seen anything like that on bears though. Perhaps bears are just better at keeping flies off. No matter what, they must have a very high tolerance for biting insects.\" Please request Truman Evert's permission prior to using his photos! 2017.09.11:409 Beadnose and her yearlings (909 & 910) relax on the banks of the Lower Brooks River video by Flyer 7474 (aka SteveCA).: 409 on the Lower Brooks River 2017 09 11 by Flyer 7474 (aka SteveCA) 2017.09.14:  409 Beadnose and her 2 yearling cubs (909 and 910)  charge a running bear, 9/4/2017 video by Birgitt. 409, 909 & 910 Charge a Running Bear 2017-09-14 15-09-28(explore.org) Video by Birgitt 2017.09.16: NPS photo of 409 Beadnose from round 2 of the 2017 Fat Bear Week contest.: 2017.10.04: 409 Beadnose goes up against her niece, 128 Grazer in round 2 of the 2017 Fat Bear Week contest.: KNP&P's October 4, 2017 12:00 Facebook post .: \"Round 2 features warrior vs. the wise with two more beefy mother bears. 409 Beadnose is raising her 4th litter this year, outperforming 128 Grazer 4 to 1 in the reproduction department.

I took this back in 2018. No one knew that this would be her last season at the falls. (I do not know who is next to her). Second image (2nd image is on 909's Bear Book Page): When I returned to Brooks Falls this past August, I witnessed a sub-adult fishing the same spot that Beadnose used. The sub-adult was aggressively defending its spot at the point against a bigger bear. It was a very spunky and very vocal bear. When I asked Ranger Sheryl who the small bear was, Sheryl responded, \"thats 909, Beadnose's daughter.\" It was so very cool to see her fish the same point as her mother.

Online fans voted bear 409 \u201cFattest Bear\u201d in the culmination of Fat Bear Week, a March-Madness style competition on the national park\u2019s social media. In a final vote on October 9th, 409 Beadnose was crowned champion for the 2ndtime in the event\u2019s five-year history. She bested another astoundingly large bear, 747, a boar whose belly barely makes clearance with the ground. A total thirteen bears from the Brooks River area of Katmai National Park were listed in the competition when it began on October 3rd. Though she was flying solo this year, bear 409 has raised four litters of cubs since being first identified as a subadult bear in 1999. After emancipating two cubs in early this year, she was able to keep all of that savory salmon to herself\u2026 allowing her to balloon into the bulging bear that captivated audiences online. This weight gain is a necessity for bears, as it helps them to survive a long winter of hibernation. Over the course of winter hibernation, a bear could lose up to one third of its body mass. In a few short months, they will have to gain it all back. This transformative weight gain was on full display during Fat Bear Week with \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d comparison photos.

This is the first season that 409 has not been observed at Brooks River since initially being classified as a subadult in 1999. 2020.01.12: January 12, 2020 was 409 Beadnose's bear celebration day on the Bearcam comments. Fencepost shared this confession about 409 Beadnose being the bear that got Fencepost addicted to Bearcam.: \"Can't find any of my own (dang!) pics or vids of Beadnose but I wanted to say how much she means to me.I have said this many times but it truly was dear Bearnose who got me hooked here. I found the cams in 2015 and watched a few minutes here, a few there. I still wasn't completely aware of what I was witnessing. Then I saw Beadnose stroll out on the falls. Her mastery of the lip, her smooth style and seemingly effortless catches blew me away. That was it, I couldn't stay away. I was so absorbed with watching the bears it took until the summer of 2016 before I found the chat! D'oh!! Thank You all for taking the pics, making the vids and digging up ones made by others. I know weAllhope our darling Beadnose strolls out onto the lip one more time.\" (p 01/12/2020 07:38 ) February 2023:  Deanna Dittloff (aka deelynnd) created this tribute video \"Beadnose and Her Legacy.\" It includes photos and videos from 2002-2022.

Now however, we know she has emancipated her cubs and is once again single. 856, perhaps more than anyone, knows this as well, and his proximity to Beadnose reveals his amorous intentions.\" 409 Beadnose was observed being courted by 856 on the morning of June 16, 2018 per Ranger Russ' June 16, 2018 10:35 comment: \"Good morning from Alaska. I'll be here the next half hour should you have any questions. Yes, we do expect to have the bearcams to be running and the Bear Book out by next week. There were no bear sightings yesterday. This morning 856 was seen pursuing 409.

Explore Live Nature Cams video: Bear 51 Diver Jr Courts 409 Beadnose June 2018 by Explore Live Nature Cams-0 In 2004, 409 Beadnose returned to the Brooks River with her 1st known litter of 1 spring cub. This cub was the original \"Velcro\". This yearling is described in NPS bear ID database as \"very large\" and engaged in long play bouts with 409. 409 and her yearling are seen in thisJune 25, 2005 photo by Don Abernathyand thisJuly 14, 2005 photo by Mullen Photography. In 2007, 409 Beadnose returned to the Brooks River with her 2nd known litter of 3 spring cubs, but soon lost one. One of the cubs was a female that was later independently identified as 130 Tundra. Another cub from this litter was known as \"Arctic\". \"Arctic\" was never independently identified as a subadult. 409 Beadnose raised 130 Tundra and \"Arctic\" through 2008. 130 Tundra (female) and \"Arctic\" were successfully emancipated by 409 Beadnose in 2009. Brooks Lodge's June 30, 2013 12:53 Facebook post with Kara Stenberg's photograph: \"Arctic\" on the hunt for Sockeyes this weekend - another great photo from Kara Stenberg: Mike Fitz, former Katmai National Park & Preserve ranger, has shared with us that \"Arctic\" was not documented as an independent subadult by park staff norassigned a bear monitoring number. Mike;s February 6, 2016 comment was: \"We never ID'd that bear (\"Arctic\") after it was weaned, or if it did return we weren't able to recognize it as 409's offspring.\" One thing to note in the comments on the June 30, 2013 Brooks Lodge Facebook post is that Tammy Carmack also participated in that comment thread and did not comment about \"Arctic\" in Kara Stenberg's photograph not being \"Arctic\", a female, or 409 Beadnose's offspring. Tammy Carmack may have been in agreement with the information Brooks Lodge posted with the photograph by Kara Stenberg. In 2012, 409 Beadnose returnd to the Brooks River with her 3rd known litter, 2 females & 1 male spring cub. The largest and smallest were females. The middle-sized cub was a male. In 2013, 409 Beadnose and her 3 yearlings remained as a family group. The largest and smallest were females. The middle-sized yearling was a male. In 2014, it is believed that 409 Beadnose successfully emancipated her 3 2.5 year-old offspring. 500 Indy is believed to be the largest of 409's offspring from this litter. There is speculation that 717 is the female runt from 409 Beadnose's 2012 litter. In 2016, 409 Beadnose returned to the Brooks River with her 4th known litter, 2 female spring cubs. 909 is believed to be the blonder female offspring and 910 is believed to be the darker female offspring from this 2016 litter. In 2017, 409 Beadnose and her 2 female yearlings remained as a family group.909 is believed to be the blonder female offspring and 910 is believed to be the darker female offspring from this 2016 litter. In 2018, 409 Beadnose returned to the Brooks River with her 2 female 2.5 year-old cubs on or before May 22, 2018. These two offspring were successfully emancipated during the 2018 season, initially observed and classified as independent subadults. 909 is believed to be the blonder of these two offspring. 910 is believed to be the darker of these two offspring. 408/409 family tree - updated Nov 2022 Littermate:408 CC (Crooked Claw) Offspring: 2004 Litter:1 spring cub, \"Velcro\" (The original \"Velcro\") 2007 Litter:130 Tundra & Arctic (individual identification number not known), Speculated 2012 Litter:500 Indy & 717 (?), Speculated 2016Litter:909 & 910, Speculated 409 Beadnose was successfully darted by Ranger Michael Saxton for the genetics study in 2016. 409 Beadnose is darted for the Genetics Study 2016 KNP&P video-0 That pink dart retrieves a DNA sample, without ever having to sedate the bear.

In the summer, she often appears to have a medium brown to gray coat as she sheds her winter fur. However, her ears are blonde tipped. With brown claws, she often transforms into a medium to dark brown bear by fall. Her ears, however, remain with their blonde tips, which is an easy identifier for this ear. 409 also has an upturned nose which appears to be \"beaded\" at the tip and lends itself to her nickname of \"Beadnose\" Life History: 409 was first identified as a subadult in 2009 and is widely believed to be a sibling of female Bear #408. Often times, especially in the fall, 409 and 408 would often be confused with one another. When not caring for cubs, 409 tends to be one of the fattest bears during the fall along the Brooks River. During the summer months, 409 becomes the poster bear for the iconic shot of a bear catching a fish in its mouth on the lip of Brooks Falls. 409 is a master lip fisher and can be seen standing atop the falls with her signature move of lifting her right front paw up while she's awaiting the jumping salmon. When the salmon jump, she uses her powerful jaw to snatch the fish, but also her right front paw to help hold the fish in her mouth. It almost seems as though 409 can get \"frustrated\" or \"impatient\" at times when unsuccessfully fishing the lip as she will use that raised right front paw to \"slap\" at the water. During the fall months, and when she is caring for cubs, she is often seen down in the Lower River near the mouth of Brooks River where it flows into Naknek Lake, or walking along the Spit. 409 has had 4 known litters of cubs (2004, 2007, 2012 and 2016) that have produced a known total of 9 cubs. She is believed to be the mother of Bear #130 Tundra (2007 litter) and Bear #500 Indy (2012 litter). In 2015, 409 won the Fat Bear Tuesday contest judged by bear cam viewers to be the fattest bear of the season."}, {"name": "435 Holly", "bio": "435 Holly July 2021 NPS photo Adult Female Year First Identified: 2001 as a young adult or older subadult (2010 book) /2001 as a young adult (2014 book) Year Last Observed: 2023 Offspring Of: Unknown Known Litters of Cubs: 5as of 2020season Genetics Study Samples Obtained: 2016 and 2017 darting attempt by Ranger Michael Saxton for the genetics study were successful. 2010 Bears of Brooks River book:435 Holly has a medium-small body with a distinctivelight blonde coat.Her ears are large and lighter than her coat.

Bears are generally selfish creatures who are not known for displays of altruism, so why would 435 Holly adopt the yearling?Some biologists hypothesize that altruism evolved in some animals is a result of shared genes. If costs to your own fitness are not too great, it would make sense for you to care for your siblings and their offspring because you share genes with them, genes that will be passed on when they reproduce. However, 402, the abandoned yearling\u2019s mother, and 435 Holly are not known to be related.

From what I was able to observe, it appears that Hollly's adopted yearling decided to assert itself over 500. The yearling initiated the interaction several minutes prior when he approached 500. This was more likely a playful approach from the yearling, but 500 wanted no part of it, perhaps because the yearling was being trailed by Holly. When the interaction began, Holly was very close to the yearling. 500 didn't want to be close to the family. When she ran, the yearling pursued and that's what the cam caught. Holly was just trying to keep up with her cubs! Subadult bears, like 500, hold the lowest position in the bear hierarchy. They are easily displaced by other bears, as this interaction demonstrates. If you are a cub, you often hold a higher position in the hierarchy than subadults because of your mother's close proximity. Times have certainly changed for the adopted yearling. Shortly after it was abandoned in July, he ran from everything. Now, he looks confidenet, well fed, and able to test some boundaries. For bear 500, she's going through a stage that all bears must endure to reach adulthood. Holly's adopted yearling may be asserting itself now, but once it is driven away by Holly, it will experience everything that 500 is enduring now.\" You can read more about the interaction in the 10/07/2014 KNP&P Terrane blog by Ranger Mike Fitz: Chasing Bigger Bears . 435 Holly's adopted yearling chases subadult bear 500 October 5, 2014 KNP&P video-1 2014.10.13: 435 Holly's biological female spring cub (now 719) is the focus of this video by JoeBear. 435 Holly can be seen urinating at the 7:50 mark.: Holly's Little Girl (719) 10.13.2014 video by JoeBear-0 2014.10.16: 435 Holly with her biological female spring cub (719) and her adopted male yearling (503 Cubadult) video by Linda Jett: 2014 10 16 0848 24 Drama Holly Attacks Chocolate Beauty by Linda Jett 435 Holly was included in the 2015 Bears of Brooks River book on page 40.: In 2015, the mixed family returned to Brooks River andwere seen together in October of that year.

At 20:58 Ranger Dave  shares a photo of 503 Cubadult by Ranger Anela: Ranger Tammy Carmack, KNP&P Bear Technician talks about the return of 435 Holly's blended family group in this KNP&P video posted on the KNP&P facebook pageon 05/23/2017. 435 Holly and the cubs can be seen in the video on the day they returned to Brooks Camp (05/21/2016). 2016.05.23: Mike Fitz, former KNP&P Ranger and Visual Information Specialist shares his thoughts about 435 Holly and both cubs returning to the river together in his Explore blog:Another Summer with Holly and Her Cubs: \"Last week, Brooks River\u2019s most famous bear family\u2014435 Holly, her biological (now 2.5 year-old) female cub, and her adopted (now 3.5 year-old) male cub\u2014were seen for a brief time at Brooks River. Last fall, the future of this family was a target for much speculation. Would 435 keep her cubs for another year? Or, is it time for them to go their separate ways? It may be too early to answer those questions definitively. Katmai\u2019s mother bears usually keep their cubs for two to three summers before separating from them. The cubs\u2019 emancipation happens in spring after the bears emerge from their dens and is not voluntary. Hormonal changes, likely related to the return of the mother bear\u2019s estrus cycle, cause her to become increasingly intolerant of her offspring. While I\u2019ve never seen this separation occur, it\u2019s been described as somewhat sudden and aggressive. The cubs may not know what\u2019s coming. \u201cIt must be a traumatic experience for the juvenile bears to be evicted by a mother who has fed and protected them all their lives,\u201d mused Will Troyer, one of the first biologists to study Katmai\u2019s bears. This is an event every bear must endure as it matures. But, late May is here and Holly still has her cubs. Does this mean the cubs will be spared from separation until next spring? Some evidence suggests they still may go their separate ways. In early May 2008, 408 CC returned to Brooks River with her three 3.5 year-old offspring. We watched them play near Brooks Lodge before they disappeared into the forest. When 408 came back that July, she was single. She drove away her cubs sometime between those two events. Bears at Brooks River usually don\u2019t vary in the amount of time they keep their offspring. If they wean them at 2.5 years, for example, then they are likely to wean subsequent litters at that age as well. 435 Holly weaned her only known surviving offspring, 89 Backpack, when he was a 2.5 year-old. We know that bears separate from their offspring at this time of the year, and Holly\u2019s biological cub from her current litter is 2.5 years old, the same age as 89 Backpack when he was weaned. However, it would be a mistake to use these anecdotes as absolute predictors for this bear family in 2016. So much of this family\u2019s history is atypical. The stress of separation might be great for newly weaned cubs, but a mother doesn\u2019t do it out of malice. Nor does she \u201cchoose\u201d to keep her cubs to be nice. The mother\u2019s biology will dictate the family\u2019s separation or continued unity.\" 2016.06.20: 435 Holly video by Ratna: Awesome Holly June 20, 2016 by Ratna 2016.06.29: 435 Holly and 856 splash and dash down the riffles video by Arlene Beech: Holly and 856 go bouncing!

I'm not sure what it might be other than scars and swellings caused by biting insects. A bear's eyelids seem to be quite vulnerable to insect bites. I once watched 409 and 634 copulating near the falls platform and through my binoculars I could see their eyes swarmed by black flies while they were preoccupied. Sometimes the skin on moose can be eaten nearly raw by flies in summer asexplained in this article.I've never seen anything like that on bears though. Perhaps bears are just better at keeping flies off.

Here are 3 Holly stories from my time volunteering at Brooks Camp last summer: 1) Holly and her two cubs were EVERYWHERE! I think I saw them more than anyone else (human or ursine). They liked to sleep on the beach in the afternoon -- greeting the planes.:-) At least one of her cubbies liked to climb on the gravel pile. And they would frequently cause bear jams near the bridge. 435 Holly seemed quite comfortable at Brooks Camp! They may have been the most visible bears in camp during July! 2) When I was there, I'd get up early (around 4:20 a.m.) and walk down to the beach. One morning, on my way to the beach, I looked down toward the Visitors Center (about 100 yards away). There, standing at the bottom of the steps, were 435 Holly and her two cubs! They were looking up the stairs toward the door of the empty building. I laughed out loud, and in my mind, I heard 435 saying, \"Here, my dear cubs, is where the humans go to learn how to behave around bears!\" 3) At Brooks Camp, you're allowed to eat a) outdoors behind an electric fence or b) in hard-sided buildings (like cabins, or at the Lodge). Many days, during my lunch break after working at the Falls platform, I would sit in the lunch building (usually alone), and I would OFTEN hear bears pulling up grass on the sides of the building. I'd look out the window, but I never saw anyone -- but I knew they were there! One day, late in July, I exited the building (singing, as always, to let the bears know I was coming) and I saw TWO BEARS, about 30 yards away. One of the bears was jumping on the back of the other and I immediately thought, \"Gosh, it's awfully late in the season for mating, isn't it?!\" And then I realized that the two bears were 435 Holly's yearlings, playing. Those. Yearlings. Were. HUGE! From where I stood, they seemed almost as big as me! I'd thought they were subadults. And they were on the path between me and the place I needed to go. Knowing that 435 was nearby, I resisted the urge to stand and watch them play (since I was closer than the 50-yard limit). So I went back inside the building and tried to watch through the window. Not the same! So grateful to have had so much sightings of the illustrious 435 and her beautiful yearlings. 435 has such a distinguished lineage (89 Backpack, 719, 503 Cubadult) -- and I can't wait to see who these yearlings become.\" Park visitor Mark Forsyth captured video of 435 Holly and her 2 yearlings in 2018.

We were stopped just beyond the gift shop by a ranger because there was a sub on the beach who could not make up its mind as to where it wanted to go. so we were talking, standing there waiting, we got the all clear signal and were just going to move and I glanced to the right and there she was Ms Holly and her chubby fat cubs sitting there quietly watching us. it was surreal, we were too close.

During a windy late Sep evening at the Lower River, her famous appetite, takes her away from her two yearlings at the bank.When a subadult shows up and her cubs bolt, she realizes how far away she is in the river and hauls her prodigious behind, to make up the distance and fully charge the sub. She turns on the afterburners in full mamma bear mode. Through rough approximations we get to run the numbers on 435's swimming and closing speed.

We were constantly on the lookout for her, hoping to get an eyeful of the curvaceous icon of Brooks River. By our third day there I had all but given up hope of seeing her. That afternoon, as we started across the bridge on our way to the falls, we stopped in our tracks and did a double take towards the spit. There she was! Her coat of many colors nearly camouflaged her among her surroundings but her hippo sized buxom behind was unmistakable! She appeared to be searching for something and we soon discovered what it was - the perfect spot to dig a belly hole. She dug and dug until she had excavated a nice, cozy trench into which she slowly settled her ample paunch. Just as she was getting comfortable, her daughter719 came strolling by with her coys, Holly's grandsons, trailing behind. She and 719 exchanged quick glances before 719 continued on her way. The adorable cubs actually sat down and stared at their grandmother. They were probably amazed at the size of her! The cubs then joined their mother in the lake while Grandma Holly drifted off, to dream of juicy salmon and fat bear titles. What a joy it was to see three generations of that family in such close proximity to each other.\" Please request Scooch'spermissionprior to using her photographs!

Meet480 Otis video by Mike Fitz: Meet 480 Otis - Bears of Brooks Falls by Mike Fitz, Resident Naturalist with Explore.org 2010 Bears of Brooks River book & 2012 Brown Bears of Brooks Camp iBook:480, along with 218, uses some of the most efficient fishing techniques at the falls. He prefers the jacuzzi, but unlike many other bears, he is often tolerant of numerous other bears around him while he eats. These bears wait patiently for him to finish and eat any leftover scraps. In September, he is one of the few bears that can successfully fish at Brooks Falls. Late in the season, he is often seen fishing the far pool. 2012 Brown Bears of Brooks Camp iBook: Additional information provided in the 2012 edition: Despite the fact that 480 is neither as large nor aggressive as other male bears, during July 2011 he was rarely displaced from his preferred fishing spot in the jacuzzi. Even 856, arguably the most aggressive bear in 2011, rarely attempted to challenge 480 for this prime location. In September, 856 and other bears seemed less tolerant of him and / or more willing to challenge him over positions at Brooks Falls. This pattern continued in July 2012, and larger bears regularly displaced him from the jacuzzi. 2014 Bears of Brooks River book:480 was first classified as an older subadult bear in 2001. He, along with #218, uses some of the most efficient fishing techniques at the falls. He prefers the jacuzzi, but unlike many other bears, he is often tolerant of numerous otherbears around him while he eats. These bears wait patiently for him to finish and eat any leftover scraps.

Despite the fact that #480 is neither as large nor aggressive as other male bears, he was rarely displaced from his preferred fishing spot in the jacuzzi. However in recent years, other mature males have surpassed him in size. As a result,480 has slipped down the bear hierarchy. Bears like 747 and 856 will now regularly displace him from his preferred fishing spots. 2015 - 2016 Bears of Brooks River books:He, along with 218, uses some of the most efficient fishing techniques at the falls. He prefers the jacuzzi, but unlike many other bears, he is often tolerant of numerous other bears around him while he eats. These bears wait patiently for him to finish and eat any leftover scraps. Despite the fact that 480 is neither as large nor aggressive as other male bears, he was rarely displaced from his preferred fishing spot in the jacuzzi from 2005-2011. However in recent years, other mature males have surpassed him in size. As a result, 480 has slipped down the bear hierarchy. Bears like 747 and 856 will now regularly displace him from his preferred fishing spots and 814 will steal fish from him. He is one of the few bears that can successfully fish at Brooks Falls in September. Late in the season, he is often seen fishing in the far pool. 480 may be one of the older bears along the river, but he was once a more playful bear. In 2003, for instance, he was observed playing with many bears including 489 and 634. 2017 Bears of Brooks River book: Additional information provided in the 2017 edition of the book: In 2016, 480 returned to Brooks River missing two canine teeth. The injury somewhat inhibited his ability to \u201chigh-grade\u201d\u2013to pick out the fattiest parts of the salmon (skin, brain, and roe)\u2013but did not stop him from putting on the necessary weight for winter survival. An experienced brown bear, missing teeth are just one more obstacle 480 has overcome to survive another year. 2018 Bears of Brooks River book:480 Otis is missing two canine teeth. The injury appears to inhibit his ability to \u201chigh-grade\u201d\u2013to pick out the fattiest parts of the salmon (skin, brain, and roe)\u2013but did not stop him from putting on the necessary weight for winter survival. An experienced brown bear, missing teeth are just one more obstacle 480 has overcome to survive year after year. 480 Otis is believed to be the oldest male bear (boar) to regularly using the falls, he faces many challenges one of which is missing teeth. He is missing two canine teeth one on the upper jaw and one on the lower jaw on the opposite side. When you watch him eat fish you can see he does so with a little more difficulty than other bears. 480 Otis is currently not known to have any offspring that use the river, In 2006-7 a DNA study was done by collecting hair and tissue samples and no known offspring of Otis were found. A new DNA study is underway at Brooks River and we may find out if he in fact does have offspring that use the river. 480 Otis has won the Fat Bear contest three years 2014, 2016 , and2017, 480 Otis was initially identified as an older subadult or young adult.

JBirdyHome shared these thoughts with the video.: \"An usual activity for Otis who is usually spotted sitting in \"the office\" (the far end of the falls, under the hanging foliage) gazing patiently at the water for hours. But here he is meandering through the water. Perhaps the water level and force of the falls is too high and rough to fish and he chooses to inspect calmer waters.\" Katmai Park Brooks Falls Otis - 480 Fishes Brooks Falls 10 9 15 by JBirdyHome 480 Otis was included in the 2016 Bears of Brooks River book on page 72.: In 2016, 480 returned to Brooks River missing two canine teeth. The injury somewhat inhibited his ability to \u201chigh-grade\u201d\u2013to pick out the fattiest parts of the salmon (skin, brain, and roe)\u2013but did not stop him from putting on the necessary weight for winter survival. An experienced brown bear, missing teeth are just one more obstacle 480 has overcome to survive another year. 2016.??.??: Cam viewer's 2016 season snapshot of 480 Otis. #1 Lani H previously added to 480's wiki page on October 27, 2016 . #2 480 Otis swats a salmon ~ BBWonderdogs previously added to 480's wiki page on October 27, 2016 . #3 BBWonderdogs previously added to 480's wiki page on October 27, 2016 .

The other bears near the far pool--503, 68--approached the fight as well. I don't have a good explanation for this behavior.

Stacey shared her story in this April 9, 2019 05:14 comment: \"Hi, everyone! A few days ago, @mazeyposted a wonderful video by @Martina of the 2018 return of Sir Uncle King 480 O T I S! (Link to video at bottom of post.) Here's a related story It was Friday, June 29, 2018, my third day volunteering at Brooks Camp. I was working in the Visitors Center, presenting a Junior Ranger badge to a visitor named Esme. It was Esme's 10th birthday -- and for her gift, she had chosen to bring her entire family to Brooks Camp to see the bears. And on her birthday, she was receiving her Junior Ranger Badge. So we're in the Visitors Center, and I'm presenting her with the badge as her family watches, and she's holding up her hand as I lead her through the Junior Ranger oath. And it's a very solemn and joyful and auspicious moment. And/but as I'm leading Esme through the oath, I'm also watching the BF cam on the TV in the Visitors Center -- and I'm seeing a large, blond bear on the island! And as I'm leading Esme through the oath, I'm thinking, \"Wait. Is that 480 O T I S?! What's he doing back? It's only the end of June!\" And that bear, 480 O T I S, *dove* into the jacuzzi, just as Esme completed her pledge! And I started to cry (which the other rangers never let me forget), because Esme became a Junior Ranger just as 480 O T I S dove into the jacuzzi, and on her 10th birthday to boot! And so, in addition, to her Junior Ranger badge, I also awarded Esme one of my very precious Bear Booster pins, for guests who went above and beyond in supporting the bears. Because Junior Ranger Esme brought her family to Brooks Camp for her 10th birthday. And 480 O T I S showed up to celebrate, too. And that is my story of 480 O T I S. And here's the great video by @Martina.

First Impressions are Everything...We went to Brooks in early July 2019 and didn't know a single bear. We were thrilled to see six bears at the Falls that afternoon. We watched a couple of bears catch and eat fish from the J. Then this very blonde bear came down the hill and started strolling towards the falls. We couldn't help but notice his very blonde poofy ears and coat coloring. #2. He checked in at the Office, but decided that wasn't the best spot, so he kindly asked a young lad to step aside. #3. He settled into his spot where all could admire his handsome physique, basking in the sunlight. #4. This bear stood out amongst the others. #5. As we left the falls, we caught another view of him, not knowing how that side would later become the talk of the town.

As I approached the Brooks Falls platform for the very first time in July 2019, I saw Otis in the jacuzzi and said/squeed two things: \"It's Otis!\" and \"He's huge!\" In hindsight, that last sounds ridiculously obvious for a bearcam fan.

The water taxi was leaving a little early because the water was rough so when we left, I was just a little disappointed that I wasn't able to see Otis. We had already left the beach when we got word we had to turn around to pick up another passenger. They told us we could have about another 30 minutes or so at Brooks. So I went back out to the bridge and there were no bears to be seen. I heard crashing in the bushes below and knew there was a bear coming through. It was Otis! He provided me an Otis-sized cherry on top of what was already a fabulous trip. I will certainly never forget it!

The earth shook, not when he moved his massive girth through the river, but when his fans around the world applauded upon seeing the old man. We often speak of the qualities that help bears survive the very challenging lives they lead and Otis is the embodiment of those qualities. At age 25 or 26, he is the river\u2019s oldest boar, yet he remains one of its most successful. Despite missing several teeth and moving a little more slowly, Otis continues to be one of the fattest bears here. His patience and tenacity are two qualities that enable him to thrive.

I got back from Brooks yesterday, spent the 10th thru the 13th there. What a land of enchantment, simply unbelievable. I had to pinch myself a few times to ensure I wasn't dreaming. The weather was amazing, not a cloud in the sky the whole time. Very few people as well. My daughter and I got to witness the return of Otis. We were down on the shore of Naknek Lake on the morning of the twelfth taking photos of the sunrise and he came out of the fog on the spit and was making his way up the lower river and we weren't far behind. We made our way to the falls, stopping at the riffles before heading on up. We were the only ones on the platform and lo and behold here came Otis headed for the falls and so did we. Once again, we were the only ones on the platform at the falls and sweet Otis made it home. What sweet memories I have now.

These pictures were all from the lower river & Naknek Lake. The picture of him in the lake is the only time I have seen him look small and a couple of shots of the fur pattern around his ears (when I was geeking-out one day). Will post more from other years later.\" 480 Otis's fur pattern near his ears are seen in photos #3 and #4. Photo #6 shows Otis with a possible split tongue.  Mike commented on Otis's possible split tongue on 6/7/2021. \"Huh. It does sort of look like that. I'll have to pay closer attention when I'm at Brooks River to confirm whether the tongue is split (certainly a possibility) or if it is just folded weirdly in the photo.\" Shel posted three snapshots of 480 Otis from 9/18/2017 with what appears to be a split tongue, #1, #2 and #3.

About an hour ago, we were talking on the chat about how Otis got his name. One idea was that it was based on the Otis Redding song, \"Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay.\" Turns out that's not the case. But ever since that post, the song has been going through my head. So... Here's the Katmai Otis version of the song. Feel free to sing along!:-) \u201cOtis at Brooks Falls\u201d With Apologies to the great Otis Redding Sittin\u2019 in the mornin\u2019 sun I\u2019ll be sittin\u2019 when the evening comes Watching the fish swim in Then I watch \u2018em swim away again.

The King, Otis Returns!! - Bear Cam Video by Explore Ranger Naomi Boak stopped in chat the evening of 7/26/2021. She shared a story and a photo of 480 Otis. \"So I had just sat down to have a martini at the Lodge, when Ranger Michael came by and said, \"I guess you didn't have your radio on. Ranger Tammy called out that 480 is in the house.\" Needless to say, i abandoned my martini, raced to my cabin to get my gear and ran to the falls. Only problem -- a bear jam. So I went back to the bridge to get in touch with Courtney to let her know and figure how we could let the world know. I actually bushwacked through the trees to get around the sleeping bear and made it to the falls to see SO many bears...and the Zen Master himself, 480 Otis. It's a miracle. I hear the champagne corks popping round the world. \" Ranger Naomi Boak stopped in chat the morning of 7/27/2021 and shared two more photos of 480 Otis in chat, #1 and #2. \"I know we are obsessed with the return of Otis, but his return was the cap to a magical day here. Early in the evening I was sitting on the bridge with Mocha-SoCal and the superintendent. It was so quietly beautiful on the lower river. I mentioned how Holly didn't travel under the bridge until late in the season last year. Not two seconds later, Holly swam right underneath us, then dove for fish! Later in the evening, three rangers (including Ranger Mo) were fishing. A longtime maintenance fellow and I watched and joked with them for a while. Then, I was on the porch of the Lodge, speaking with the woman who works with the walruses at Round Island when I heard the news about Otis. Yes, another magical day at Brooks Camp.

Today was one of those two. Oof. On such days, I checked cams every 30 minutes to see if chat had exploded -- a sure sign of Otis' return. On this particular day, I was with my daughter and her newborn -- it was truly a lovely day! And at exactly 5:55 EDT, as that baby lie sleeping on my lap, I checked BF and... WAIT. THAT'S OTIS. Highlights? No. THAT'S. OTIS! I grabbed a snap, and then I quietly, but swiftly handed off my beloved granddaughter and explained I had to leave. I have to go count fish, I said. I knew my daughter would understand -- she works at a shelter and is an animal lover herself. \u2665 She did.:) And so it began.:) I'm sure y'all, especially those of you who doubted his return, have similar stories you're going to repeat of when and where you were when Otis returned in 2023 -- just like 2021, when he also returned on July 26 -- while he meandered from one cam to the next to come home to us.

Terry Miller (aka sundogsNM) counted 5 fish brought by 907. Terry Miller (aka sundogsNM) recorded 3 of the 5 share sessions.Sharing fish is not a common behavior among brown bears, especially a boar sharing with another boar. A healthy younger boar sharing with a frail aged adult boar has been previously documented at Brooks River one other time....16 Cinnamon in 2011, the final season 16 was observed using the Brooks River. A second observation of this rare brown bear behavior begs some questions, for example: Do brown bears sense things we have not even considered? Do brown bears have the capacity to take care of one another in a desperate time of need with regard to survival? One things these amazing creatures have taught us is that even after all this time, we still have much to learn.: Part 1 - 907 brings fish, 480 Otis protects his scrap, 907 checks it but leaves for more fishing.: 08 Aug 2023- 480 Otis and 907 share, part 1 (explore.org) video by Terry Miller (aka sundogsNM) Part 2 - 907 brings fish number 3, 480 Otis is full but picking at scraps.: 08 Aug 2023- 480 Otis and 970 share fish, part 2 (explore.org) video by Terry Miller (aka sundogsNM) Part 3 - 907 brings fish number 5, 480 Otis seems excited to see 907, but 480 mostly stares at the scraps while 907 eats.: 08 Aug 2023- 480 Otis and 970 share fish, part 3 (explore.org) video by Terry Miller (aka sundogsNM) In addition to the 5 salmon 907 shared with 480 Otis on August 8, 2023, 480 Otis had a successful independent fishing day of his own.

Now of course 480 Otis must consume those fish in view of the live cams along the Brooks River that are available through the partnership between Katmai National Park & Preserve and Explore.org for those fish to be counted. Nature's Folio provides a daily 480 Otis Fishing Report on the website.  OtisFishingReport.com is a collection of Otis Fishing Reports. Otis\u2019 goal? Get fat! Seriously. He yearns to gain enough weight to get through another year of hibernation. And to that end, Otis loves to eat wild Alaskan sockeye salmon. Explore the Secret Sauce page of OtisFishingReport.com to discover what an Otis fishing report is, why the Otis fishing report was started, how to decode the Otis fishing report lingo (abbreviations that appear in the report), and how to comment on the Otis fishing reports.  The origin of 480 Otis' name is not known; it is not recorded in the bear monitoring data base. Sometimes names are just given arbitrarily and Ranger Mike said that he would be willing to bet that is the case with Otis...someone just liked that name Otis.  ...After more investigative magic by Mike Fitz...the answer is revealed! On 7/4/2019 during a Play-by-Play at Brooks Falls, Mike Fitz explained how 480 got his nickname . Mike said \"This is number 480, he is nicknamed Otis. He got that nickname actually because of the shape of his ears, just oval shaped ears. Maybe it doesn't make that much sense to go from oval shape to Otis but that is how he got his nickname.\"  Unfortunately the video of the 07/04/19 play-by-play, linked above, is not currently available. Fortunately Mazey had transcribed the above information from that play-by-play and added it to the wiki. THANK YOU MAZEY for preserving the answer to the frequently asked question: \"How did 480 Otis get his nickname?\"! 480 Otis has almost mastered keeping his courting and mating behaviors from being captured by cam viewers and park visitors (or at least he has benefited from much of it being hard to locate for sharing). However, a little is now known about 480's reproductive adventures: 2017.07.09: 480 Otis courting an adult female video by Brenda D.Note: Video unavailable as of 2021.

Anna-Marie shared some additional information about her photo: The photo \"was taken from the Treehouse. Otis and the female (might be 289) were under the walkway between the treehouse and the riffles platform \". \"Right after the mating, both bears showed up down by the riffles and moved up toward the Falls. Another bear followed her up the path on the other side of the river and then Otis followed them! \" Please request Anna-Marie's permission prior to using her photos! 708 Amelia was observed being courted by 480 OtisbetweenJune 21, 2018andJuly 9, 2018.: Please request Mocha's permission prior to using her photos! 480 Otis is currently not known to have sired any offspring that use the Brooks River, In 2005 - 2006a geneticsstudy was done by collecting hair and tissue samples;no known offspring of 480 Otis were discovered.

Popeye saw the movement and went in for the capture ....he went out of frame as he pounced. So we didn't see if he was successful or not. He was gone about 5 minutes. Minutes after he returned he was violently ill....not the usual salmon colour.....but a very dark substance. Guess you could call it \"Otter's Revenge\".     Video by Brenda D.

Could 410 be the mother of 634 Popeye?: \"I know that 410 day isn\u2019t until the 19th but while looking through my 2016 snapshots for pics of 409, I found some of 410. But what I noticed immediately looking at some of the pics is that her she has a \u201c crabby\u201d face and what struck me is that 634 Popeye has her very same expression. Lips etc aren\u2019t the same but there\u2019s a lot that is the same. Is there a possibility that Popeye is her son? I don\u2019t know if she had any male coy that lived?\" Kisper Samoyed made the same observation some time ago:  \"I noticed that some time age and sent an email to Ranger Michael to see if our thoughts are correct. No answer as of now.\" KCanada replied to GreenRiver:  \"He was first identified as an \u201colder subadult\u201d in 2002, so if he were a cub of hers it would have to be her 1998 litter where she had one coy. I have no idea what became of that cub, though or what its gender was. ...\" GreenRiver shared these snapshots:  \"Well, When I saw this one pic of 410, it just reminded me of Popeye. So I did find a snapshot of Popeye from this past season. I just think they look similar. Maybe it\u2019s just because they both seem to be frowning in these pics.:)I know I\u2019ve seen other pics that look like he is frowning.\" Add here A special thank you to StMango for the NPS photos from the 2012 Brown Bears of Brooks Camp iBook.

From Meet Bear 854 Divot video: Watch this Meet Bear 854 Divot video by Mike Fitz, Resident Naturalist with Explore.org to learn identification and distinctive behaviors that will help you identify 854 Divot. Meet Bear 854 Divot - Bears of Brooks Falls by Mike Fitz, Resident Naturalist with Explore-0 2018 Bears of Brooks River book:Over the past several years, her use of the river has varied considerably. In some years (2013) she used the river infrequently, while in others (fall 2014) she was seen almost daily. As a young bear, she was often seen at the mouth of Brooks River in May digging in exposed gravel, apparently attracted to those spots by rotten scraps of salmon from the previous year. The divots she left in the gravel inspired her nickname. 854 has learned to associated people with fish. In the lower Brooks River, she will often sit or lie on the shore while people fish nearby. She often looks like she is resting and not paying attention to the water, but when someone hooks a fish, she quickly enters the water in pursuit of an easy meal. Each time a bear takes a fish from someone\u2019s fishing line it reinforces that behavior. The bear is then more likely to approach people in the future with the idea of obtaining food. 854 Divot's year of birth. 854 Divot is the 2002 offspring of 216 Marilyn and 24 BB (aka Bald Butt) .

Mission to save Bear 854, Divot, from a wolf snare, video by Katmai National Park and Preserve 2014.07.29: 2014.07.29 - 2014.07.30: Katmai rangers kept bearcam viewers updated on the mission to save 854 Divot. Part of those updates came via this Explore.org blog: Update on Divot the bear \"Update on Divot the BearFrom theBear CamRangers in Katmai National Park: Earlier today, many of you saw the sow with a single cub at the Lower River. That is believed to have been Divot, 854, now with only one cub. That alone would be news, but it also appears that she has been caught in a wolf snare, broken free, but still has the snare around her neck. From the photos we have, it looks as if it has cut into her neck. Our plan is to attempt to tranquilize her on Tuesday and remove the snare. This is a long shot, as she has not been routinely seen this year and we may not even be able to locate her. Perhaps with fewerBrooks Campvisitors and a fair number of salmon around she will linger just a while longer. Keep your fingers crossed. Update at 2pm PST:Divot\u2019s Last Known Location\u2013 see photo above. From Ranger Roy, \u201cDivot and cub were seen a few hours ago near Brooks Camp, but have since moved to the creek on the north side of Dumping Mountain and have disappeared into the forest. The biologist who will do the darting is almost here. If she continues up the creek to fish it will nearly be impossible to track her. let\u2019s hope she moves back down to the beach where she can be seen. Unfortunately, the winds are also picking up, which greatly complicates matters. Update at 7pm PST:From Ranger Jeanne, \u201cHere is a map [see above] that depicts the locations where 854 Divot was seen. On July 12, I took photos of 854 Divot on the Brooks River. On July 24, bearcam viewer CalliopeJane took a photo of 854 Divot somewhere between Big Creek and Naknek River Camp. I do not have the exact GPS coordinates of the location where CalliopeJane took the photo. The GPS point on the map marks Divot\u2019s location earlier today. When she was first seen this morning, she was on the road moving in the direction of the Brooks Falls trailhead. She traveled down Brooks River, onto the gravel bar, on the beach to Mortuary Point and around the north shore of Dumpling Mountain in just a few hours. The last I heard from Ranger Mike around noon today, she had gone into the woods near the GPS point. Hopefully Rangers Roy and Mike will have an update later tonight.\u201d Update at 7:30 pm PST:From Ranger Roy, \u201cHello all: We are back, and despite seeing Divot and cub briefly, we were unsuccessful at tranquilizing her. Here is what happened: This morning, Divot and cubs were seen at about 8:30am at Lake Brooks, Rangers began following her on foot and continue dot do so until she reached Dumpling Creek. She and her cub were last seen fishing Dumpling Creek around 11:00am, and then disappeared up the creek. Around 1:30, we arrived on scene with the biologist that is licensed to administer tranquilizers. We did a sweep of the heavily forested and steep terrain, and while we saw recent evidence of bear activity, we saw neither of them. We returned to the boats and waited. One boat patrolled the lakeshore looking for her, the other waited where she was last seen. After about 90 minutes, we were preparing to leave and we saw her a few hundred yards down the beach. She rapidly closed the distance faster than we could prepare for the shot and she went right up the creek again. Even if we had been ready we may not have taken the shot because having her head back of the creek again while tranquilized would have made it difficult for us to deal with her and locate her. The park plane was in the area and flew the creek and observed that she continued up the creek. We waited for her return, but had to call it off because after tranquilizing a bear, it takes about 4 hours for them to be fully in control again, and it would have put us out there after dark. We will continue looking for her early Wednesday morning around camp, and will also go back to her little salmon fishing paradise, too. I was unable to read too far into the thousands of comments, but I get the idea that some have speculated that we have received resistance from above. That is absolutely false. We requested assistance from our regional office and received it within minutes. The perceived delay was not because of red tape, it was purely logistical\u2013Nothing happens fast in bush Alaska. We did not have to get permission from anyone to address the issue, we simply had to locate people with the necessary skills and equipment and then transport them to one of the most remote places on earth, hence the 24hr delay. The wire that is around her neck may be a snare, or it may be something else. We won\u2019t know for sure until we remove it. Trapping is not allowed in the park, but this sow and cub are easily capable of traveling outside the park in a few days. There is currently no reason to jump to the conclusion that there is poaching in the park. If it is indeed a snare, it may have been accidentally left behind last winter. Trapping is generally done for furs, and this is the wrong season for that. Too much shedding going on. I will probably edit this again, but I wanted to get an update to you all as soon as possible. Please do not assume that something nefarious is going on when we are silent. We had 8 people on the ground and three in a plane looking for her. All who have been involved in attempting this rescue have Divot\u2019s best interest at heart at all times.\u201d Update 7/30 at 10am PST: From Ranger Roy, \u201cDivot was just spotted and we are off to try again. It may be hours before my next update, so please be patient and try not to get sucked into too much speculation. I will give you a full report upon my return.\u201d Update 7/30 at 7pm PST:Today, rangers and biologist tranquilized and treated a female bear with a wire snare tightly wound around her neck. The snare was removed and an iodine-like liquid (betadine) was applied to her wound.Look for a live chat with Ranger Roy and Mike about this situation later this week, or join the discussion now in the comments stream on the #bearcam.\" 2014.07.30: Ranger Grant Hilderbrand, NPS Wildlife Biologistand his team of KNP&P rangers successfully locate, sedate, and removed the wire snare from 854 Divot's neck Mission to Save 854 Divot video: Mission to save Bear 854, Divot, from a wolf snare by KNP&P 2014.08.04: Katmai Terrane Blog: Removing a Wire Snare from 854 Divot by Ranger Mike Fitz. 854 Divot and her remaining yearling can be seen in front of the lower river platform in this September 2014 video by Anna-Marie_AZ.

I have two Divot stories to share from my time volunteering at Katmai in July. 1) Every morning, I would wake up early (around 4:20 a.m.) and walk down to the beach at Naknek Lake. Since I was alone, I would sing (usually Beatles classics), to let the bears know I was coming.:-) One morning, it was kind of dark. I was walking down the trail to the beach, singing -- and suddenly I heard a \"huff\" just in front of me! Suddenly, a bear: Close enough to touch! (Though I didn't.) I jumped back, still singing -- and realizing that I'd woken up a BEAR that had been sleeping by the side of the trail! I backed up, still singing, and saying, \"You're okay, bear, you're okay.\" And I walked back from the beach to my housing. The bear stayed where it was and, I think, went back to sleep. I learned later that the bear was 854 Divot! She'd dug a sleeping hole on the side of the trail -- directly across from one of the ranger's cabins -- and had been sleeping there when I walked by. What I learned: Bears can move from sleeping to standing VERY quickly.:-) 2) Here is my second 854 Divot story: I was at Katmai for six weeks -- and only ONCE did I hear a bear coming. I was standing by the Ranger's Station, talking to one of the rangers -- the same morning that I'd woken up 854 on the trail. As we chatted, I suddenly heard (and felt) the sound of running bears. The ranger and I jumped up onto the porch of the Rangers Station -- just in time to see 854 chasing a subadult down the trail where the ranger and I had just been standing. (If we hadn't jumped up on the porch, the bears would've knocked us over.) What I learned; Bears normally walk VERY quietly. It's kind of astounding how soft their tread is. But when they run, they can move VERY fast. Thanks, 854 Divot, for the good and important lessons! \" Stacey also shared these two 2018 season memories of 854 Divot: \"Two other memories of 854 Divot from this summer: 1) She liked to nap -- and we would often see her sleeping under a tree very near the Riffles platform.She seemed comfortable being near the platform, even when it was crowded. 2) One very warm day, she feel asleep in the river, just to the left of the Riffles platform. Her head was above water, but her belly was completely submerged. Some people were worried about her! But I think she was just trying to stay cool. I wondered if the Riffles cam was able to see her sleeping in the water.\" Park visitor, Tommy Hays captured these photographs of 854 during the 2018 season: Photo #1 854 , #2 854 & #3 854 .

A sow with a single spring cub purused the lower river, fishing and coming into brief conflict with bear 854 and her two coy. Bear 854 seemed to find success in fishing at Lake Brooks.

We suspect that #500 is one of #409 Beadnose's most recent litter, but we can't be 100% sure without hard scientific evidence. We did have a DNA study done a number of years ago that told us some interesting things. For example, we know that #854 Divot's father and grandfather were the same bear, whom we have not seen in a number of years. In some cases cubs have distinct features (like #130 Tundra's scar) which we can use to identify them as they grow older and leave their mother. Next year we hope to begin a new DNA study that will give us some new scientific data and confirm some of our suspicions about who is related to whom.\" LTC asks: \"So would that mean that BB #24 is also Marilyn #216's father?\" Ranger Aaron Camire's October 7, 2014 15:51 comment \"Yes\": Ranger Aaron Camire's October 7, 2014 16:38 comment: \"There is some interbreeding. #24 BB was #854's father and grandfather. We know this through genetic studies that were done a few years ago, and we are planning to start a new genetics program next year. When bears get kicked out by their mother, they sometimes disperse to other areas. This especially true for young males- females tend to stay in the same area they were raised. This probably helps to avoid inbreeding somewhat. It's also important to keep in mind when young bears don't return to the area.\" 854 Divot, 790 Weevil Bear, 24 BB and 216 Marily were all successfully sampled between 2005and 2007 during Ranger Tamara Olson's genetics study. 854 Divot was successfully darted by Ranger Michael Saxton on October 5, 2016.

He also fishes the falls in September and October.747 does not appear to be wary of people on the viewing platforms near Brooks Falls and is sometimes seen near the mouth of the Brooks River. In years past, he was rarely seen in areas with high numbers of people.747 was not regularly seen at Brooks Falls until fall.

She would fish the falls, with impunity from other bears, under their protective guard.....and took full advantage of that fact....day, after day, after day.;))) She had not been seen with a new litter of cubs since 2007.Have often wondered, was she courting for procreation, or open access to her favourite fishing spot???Why would she follow them?

At the 2:30 mark when the live cam widens the view, 410 can be seen fishing in the far pool and it becomes visible that 747 has also taken notice of 814 Lurch's arrival on the scene. 83 Wayne Brother holds his position on the North side remaining close to or on the bank. 747 displays his cowboy walk as he heads in the direction of 814 Lurch. At the 2:50 mark 89 Backpack begins his retreat to the top of the falls. At the 3:09 mark, 83 Wayne Brother begins his retreat up the hill on the North side of the river below the falls.

At 3:32 89 Backpack moves from his seated position on the rock and heads up river. 410 also begins to move from the far pool and also makes her way above the falls as 747 comes closer. At 3:43, 814 Lurch moves down river towards the island. At 4:04 410 moves closer to the edge of the falls with 747 still remaining in the far pool. 89 Backpack makes his retreat out of view. At 4:40, 410 begins to test the option of returning to the far pool but by 4:47 as 747 moves in her direction, she rethinks that option and backs off a bit. When 410 determines that it is safe she does climb back down from above the falls and 747 continues to court 410. At 5:45, 747 takes a seat and guards 410 while she fishes in the far pool.

Read my full breakdown of the video\" at Mike Fitz' October 14, 2016 blog: Strut Your Stuff .\"In the video, 747 is the heftier, darker bear. 68 is the tall, lanky bear. Both are mature adult males, likely in the prime of their lives. As I see it, bear 747 comes out of this on top as he asserts his dominance over the newcomer, 68. This took some time, however. 68 didn\u2019t exactly yield like most would upon the approach of 747.As the video starts, 747 (left) immediately approaches the newcomer on the island. 68 subtly skirts 747, but continues his approach toward the falls. You can see that 747 is much bulkier than the newcomer, but the new bear is just as tall, if not taller.:When 747 turns his back on the new bear, 68 takes the opportunity to mark some grass (0:50). 68 is not acting submissive or yielding.The new bear approaches 747. 747 stands and watches. At this point, the outcome is very much undecided (1:12).After a little more posturing, 747 turns to mark the willow on the island. This is a bold display of dominance in front of 68. The newcomer though continues to cowboy walk away from 747, still not submissive but very focused on 747\u2019s movements (2:00).747 follows the exact same route on the island as 68, probably following the newcomer\u2019s scent and leaving his own on the way (2:20). 68 postures more in the grass. 747 again marks the tree. This time for almost 30 seconds (3:18).747 then goes to the grass where 68 just was and rubs it on his body. He seems to want to leave a scenttrail everywhere his competitor has (4:05).68 walks downriver. 747 follows. In the riffles, 747 catches up to him. Instead of fighting, the bears posture more. Here\u2019s where 747 seems to assert his dominance more clearly. 68, instead of posturing further, stands in the riffles and watches 747 approach then walk away (5:00).The video cuts to a moment a few minutes later when 68 makes his way back to the island. This draws 747\u2019s attention and he approaches 68 again. 747\u2019s ears remain upright and forward, a sign of dominance in this context. The new bear\u2019s ears are oriented back against his head, a sign of defensiveness (6:40).747 circles 68. 747 walks away and the newcomer stands and watches, indicating that 747 successfully asserted his dominance in the interaction. 747 then goes back to the island and marks the vegetation again (7:05). 68 continues to stand and watch.

Bears on Kodiak and the Alaska Peninsula are famous for their size and 747 ranks among the largest brown bears on Earth. Adult males in Katmai average 700-900 lbs in mid summer. 747, however, tips the scales on the heavy side of that. It's no exaggeration to estimate his weight at 900-1000 lbs right now. Last fall,his weight was estimated at an astounding 1,400 lbs.

One more 856 story: It was July 2019 (I think), around 6 p.m. I'd been volunteering on the Brooks Falls platform, and had stayed after my shift to watch the bears. The platform was unusually empty; it was the rare quiet hour between the daytime crowd and the nighttime crowd when most visitors had left to get dinner. So it was me and a younger couple on the platform, watching the bears. 856 and 747 were fishing at the falls, and there was a young female bear fishing in the riffles. 747 decided to go down to the riffles to say hello to the female. And suddenly, 856 decided he was interested in her, too. The poor female (I didn't recognize her, but she seemed very young) made a quick getaway. 747 decided to follow -- until 856 decided he wasn't happy about that, and started pursuing 747. From the Riffles, 747 (followed by 856) moved up toward the falls. Then the two boars marched toward the BF platform (where the couple and I stood watching, agape). They went up to our left, toward the fish ladder, then UP THE HILL behind the platform, so that they stood at eye level to us: 856 following 747, not running, but in deliberate pursuit, sending a message. Poor 747 moved behind the platform and into the woods on the right side of the platform (where BF low sometimes looks backward into the woods). We saw 747 emerge into the riffles, 856 still walking deliberately behind. They repeated their circle of the BF platform -- once again standing eye level to us, just a few yards away. I have never been so transfixed. Eventually, the two bears disappeared into the woods by the Riffles. At that point, the three of us started breathing again. We felt like we had witnessed the most incredible bear activity of the day -- and only the three of us had seen it. At the end of this, the couple needed to get back to the lodge for dinner -- but we were well aware that the two bears had disappeared into the woods near the riffles, and we really didn't want to encounter them on the Brooks Falls Trail! So we hung out for a little bit, giving the bears time to disperse, then walked back down the BF Trail together, talking loudly all the way so that the bears knew we were there. And guess what: We DID encounter a bear on the trail! But it was the female that they'd initially been interested in -- not the two males. An exciting -- and breathtaking -- display of dominance. We felt so privileged to have experienced this. On 2/21/2021 scooch replied to Stacey's story: \"Hi Stacey! That incident that you described may be part of these two gifs that I recorded on July 6, 2019.

Yet, the bears still didn\u00b4t know they were not going to find dinner in Brooks River that day and, to my luck and delight, the most part of the Big Boys showed up at the falls that evening. 83 Wayne Brother was one of them. He entered the river near the riffles area and walked slowly toward the falls. 32 Chunk in the Jacuzzi, 755 Scare D Bear in the far pool and 747 on the conveyor belt were the bears hanging out at the falls when he approached. He stood by the \u201chole\u201d for a few seconds, but as soon as 747 saw him, the bear of colossal proportions decided to remind 83 Wayne Brother he was the top bear at the falls while 856 was not around.  They both exchanged some harsh words, and when 747 felt it was enough, he turned around and left. 83 Wayne Brother sat and stared at 747 wondering what he had done to deserve that. After a few seconds, he decided it was better to find dinner somewhere else.\" Pictures taken on July 7, 2019 Olatz Azcona Mun\u00e1rriz shared six additional 7/7/2019 photos of 747 0n 4/3/2022, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5 and #6. \"747 was the only boar I saw catching a couple of salmon at the falls during my first evening in Brooks River on July 7, 2019. He was not so lucky two days later, on July 9, when he also spent some time at the falls while I stood on the platform. That evening, he only got harsh words and a display of dominance on the island from 856, the top bear in Brooks River that year.\" Please request Olatz Azcona Mun\u00e1rriz's permission prior to using their photographs!

Stacey's calm demeanor and communication with other Rangers on the radio can be seen in the 2 videos posted.On 1/22/2020 at 05:18 Stacey shared her experience while assisting two visitors on the Brooks Falls trail.Park visitor Sunion81 filmed the 2 videos. In Instagramvideo #1,2 subadults (901 and possibly 821 or his sister 831) are walking on the trail, sense 747's approach and quickly run forward. Invideo #2,747 comes lumbering by at a normal pace, probably only interested in getting to the falls to fish. \"STORYMazey posted a video yesterday from my time volunteering at Brooks in July. And that led me to a second video that was posted this morning. Here's the story behind those videos. It was the second or third week of July 2019 -- a Wednesday, I think -- and on this day I was volunteering on the Brooks Falls platform. It was early in the morning -- around 8 or 9 a.m. AK time -- and I was the first person assigned to the BF platform shift. I'd arrived at the platform, dropped off my gear, and then walked back to the Falls Trail for my first assignment -- a 90-minute \"rove\" on the Falls Trail. (A rove is when you walk around an area -- assisting guests, answering questions, and just generally being visible.) As I exited the platform to the Brooks Falls trail, I saw two guests -- I'll call them Juan and Maria -- smiling, and walking briskly up the trail in my direction. From Spain, they were halfway through their three-day stay at Brooks Camp, and they were excited to be among the first viewers on the platform in the a.m. We recognized each other (I'd met them the day before), and we exchanged friendly greetings. And suddenly, I heard the sound of running bears behind me. I looked over my shoulder, and saw two subadults running down the hill. They skidded to a halt, and started play fighting right in front of the BF gate! Juan immediately reached for his camera, as I told the couple we needed to move quickly off the trail. We stepped into the woods off the trail where we'd met, about 20 yards away from the play fighting bears. This was NOT a situation I wanted to be in! I'd encountered bears on the trail before -- single bears, subadult bears, moms with cubs-- but I'd never been that close to a pair of play fighting subadults before. As Juan filmed the bears, I explained what was happening -- that these young bears (the teenagers of the bear world) were play fighting with each other -- and asked the guests to move as far back on the trail as they could, since the bears were paying attention to each other, and not to us. I was concerned that at some point, the play fighting would stop and the bears would run down the trail, knocking down anyone who happened to be in their way. And then, suddenly, a new development: \"The situation has changed,\" I said to Juan and Maria. \"I see a big bear -- Bear 747 -- walking toward the gate from the river. These two subadults don't know he's there yet. But when they see him -- or smell him -- they're going to run. So let's push even further back into the forest if we can.\" Still filming, Juan and Maria moved further back into the forest, away from the trail. At that point, someone called out from down the trail, maybe 20 yards further away from the gate than us. It was a ranger -- hooray! She'd heard me talking to Juan and Maria, and she wanted me to know that she could hear me, even though we couldn't see each other. \"You're doing great,\" she said. \"Just keeping talking, and have your bear spray ready.\" \"I don't have bear spray,\" I sighed. As I watched 747 walk slowly toward the gate -- and the playing bears -- I reminded Juan and Maria of what we'd learned in bear school. \"Let's keep talking,\" I said. \"I know you're from Spain, and you can speak Spanish if you want to. I'm pretty sure these bears speak Spanish.\" So in the background of the first video, you can hear me narrating -- partly to keep calm, partly so the bears would know where we were, and partly so that the ranger down the trail would know what was happening. And you can hear Juan and Maria speaking Spanish, too. Once the play fighting subadults saw 747, they left the gate and starting heading down the trail in front of us -- walking at first, and then running (as I thought they might) to get away from 747. But things weren't over yet! Once a bear walks past, a visitor's first instinct is often to hurry out of the woods and back onto the trail. But that was NOT a good option here, especially since I had a hunch that 747 would follow the less dominant bears down the trail. So we waited in the woods -- still talking -- until Bear 747 went past. And that's what you see in the second video. Once the ranger advised that 747 was 50 yards down the trail, we exited the woods, checked our surroundings, met up with the ranger, and walked together toward the BF gate. It was an exciting beginning to an eventful day. As I recall, there were, at one point, more than a dozen bears on the trail that day -- subadults, moms with cubs, 747, etc. They caused multiple bear jams and kept the rangers busy. I'm grateful to Juan and Maria for paying attention in bear school. And grateful, too, for the ranger, who managed things from down the trail.It's not a situation I wanted to be in, but I'll remember it for a long time -- not just because of the bears, but also because of the people involved.

I pulled the curtain back to see a brown bear quickly digging a hole near the foundation. I started filming through the thin panes of glass and then as the bear rolled over I remembered our bear training to let the bears do what they do so stepped away. I learned later that seeing the curtain opening was good to prevent him from doing further digging. Anyway, this is 747 who won Katmai NP\u2019s Fat Bear Week last year so a bit of a celebrity sighting as well. I\u2019ll never forget the time I was less than a couple of feet from a brown .\" 2021.05.26:   Ranger Naomi stopped in chat on 5/28/2021.

I walked swiftly back to camp to find the bear tech on duty to tell her that 747 was heading to camp. And head to camp he did, sauntering from the lower river to the beach and in and out of the woods. On the way, he decided to let others know he had been around.

Thank you for all your kind words. Here's a big guy who wasn't in the 8...probably because the best face pics I got of him this summer were likely (?) posted months ago. At any rate, this first one is of 747 walking through camp, probably because Tinder was down. Unfortunately, both of these pics had to be taken through a window...and that's especially evident in this first one. But I like it because it's a reminder of what might be right outside your cabin door.

We were walking down the trail when this large boar emerged from the woods. We parted to the side and he started up the path to the falls, stopped and turned around. I was standing alone and the bear walked within a foot of me and made eye contact. I could smell him. I could hear him breathing. He paused briefly then kept walking down the trail. I have never had an experience like that. I was both mesmerized and terrified at the same time. It was incredible.  After talking with rangers and other Katmai bear fans, it was decided this bear is 747, the winner of the 2020 fat bear contest. \" Note: This account has been made private. 2021.06.25:  747 stopped by the falls the evening of 6/25/2021, video by JG.

Not catching anything, he retired up the hill. He came back to the J a short time later and caught a fish. Instead of his usual routine of taking it to the island to eat he went up the fish ladder to consume it. That is when 747 showed up. Chatter FatBearChamp747 gives a verbal play-by-play below. FatBearChamp747 described their interpretation of the first interaction between 747 and 856. \"Went back and watched the 1st confrontation between 747 & 856 and it was even more amazing than the 2nd one - 856 Finally catches a salmon in they J - Yay the salmon are back! - but instead of eating it in the J or by the Island like he normally does, 856 climbed the ladder and went above the falls to eat his catch by 812's dinner rock - was the King of the Falls the last 10 years actually worried about getting his Salmon stolen? - then 747 climbs the ladder and approaches 856, he doesn't try to steal his fish buts puts on a full dominance display - with two tree markings above the Falls and one below by the viewing platform for good measure as he left (beginning to understand how 747 got those racing stripes on his back) maybe this is why 856 has been so anxious for the Salmon to come, he knows he is not as big as 747 is right now, maybe it won't last but at least for the moment it does look like there is a new sheriff in town.\" FatBearChamp's subsequent comment. \"OMG the crushing down of the tree as 747 approached 856 - lol - it's King Kong vs Godzilla and King Kong won the first two rounds - 747 was not intimidated by 856 even a little bit, maybe 747 will pay fir this insubordination later in the season but for now it sure does look like there has been a change at the top.\" Mike Fitz gave his interpretation of the events. \"That was quite an interesting confrontation between 747 and 856, two of the river's largest and most dominant bears. Initially, I couldn't tell if 747 approached 856 because he wanted some of 856's salmon or if 747 was just feeling strong enough to challenge 856 for dominance. Either way, 747 demonstrated some boldness by directly approaching 856 and marking trees in front of him. After 747 moved away, 856 reciprocated a bit and also marked some of the trees near the fish ladder. However, I would score that confrontation as a draw. No bear seemed to yield to the other and much of their behavior was obscured by vegetation. But about 10 minutes later, 747 directly approaches 856 below the falls. 856 yields upon 747's approach! Then 747 turns his back and walks away. Since this wasn't a conflict over a fishing spot then it's a clear indication that 747 \"won\" the interaction and at the moment can be considered more dominant. If we see 856 yield to 747 again, then we'll know there has been a shift in the hierarchy. For more than a decade, 747 has yielded to 856. That may have just changed.\" Blair-55 posted this gif of the 747 (left) and 856 (right) interaction. Mike Fitz commented about the two boars body language a short time later. after viewing Blair's gif. \"This captures the interaction well. 747: Head up, ears forward, direct approach--all signs of dominance. 856: Head slightly lowered, ears back, walking backwards while opponent approaches--all signs of submission.\" Hey Princess's 6/28/2021 video that captures both interactions. 856 and 747 confrontation display of dominance Explore.org 06.28.21 Video by Hey Princess GA Bear's 6/28/2021 video that captures the jacuzzi interaction.

According to msn, Cara Siciliano (Mrsb111) is the park visitor that captured the above video of 747.  According to Right This Minute, Cara Siciliano is known as Mrsb111 on tik tok.  Right This Minute also discusses Explore.org in their segment that included Cara Siciliano's video of 747.   Mike Fitz, Resident Naturalist with Explore.org and former KNP&P Ranger, shared this interpretation of 747's behavior observed in the above videos by Mrsb111 and Cozy Club.  Mike also shared some best practices for park visitors to utilize to increase safety (for both park visitors and the bears) while cohabitating with the bears of Brooks River.:   \"In the video, 747 was stressed. You can hear him jaw-popping when he turned around. His vocalizations and movement could've been a reaction to the presence of people or something else. I'm not sure.   One note I would like to add about getting off the trail: While it is important to give bears the right-of-way, it equally important to give bears as much space as possible. That means getting off the trail as far as you can before the bear is close by. However, separating yourself from the bear's space isn't always possible due to the design of trails at Brooks River. The forest behind the group recording the video is quite thick, for example. They might not have had time to move off the road before 747 was too close. In a situation when it doesn't seem like you have time to move away safely, then standing your ground and letting the bear choose how it will avoid you is often a good decision. Situations like these are common at Brooks Camp. With the exception of the wildlife viewing platforms most infrastructure at Brooks Camp, including the trails, are not designed or well placed to separate people from bears. Most bears at Brooks Camp expect to encounter people on trails, though, so sticking to the trails and roads can certainly help increase your safety. Along with staying on designated trails, I encourage anyone who visits Brooks Camp to hike in groups, remain  aware of your surroundings to the best of your ability, and plan ahead for what you will do in a surprise encounter.\" DanteV2000 shared the two following photographs (#1 & #2) that show the location of the park visitors and 747 and provide a visual perspective that while not available in the park visitor's video, demonstrates Mike Fitz' comment about the limited area the park visitors had available to them to yield space to 747.  This is also a very good example of how what we are able to see in a video, in a photograph, or on the live cams does not always tell us everything we need to know to understand what exactly we are seeing.: Giant Bear Casually Walks Past Tourists in Alaska's Katmai National Park 747 in 2021 (August 3, 2021 or prior) by Cara Siciliano via Storyful Fun Fact:  The KNP&P sign that 747 appears to look at in the above video, the one that sits at the Brooks Falls trailhead, was painted by Sara Wolman, former KNP&P Ranger.  You can see it as a work in progress on Sara's October 17, 2016 instagram post. On August 10, 2021 at 12:37 AKDT during the live comment chat on the dedicated Live Chat cam comments, Mike Fitz, also shared this information about the above video by Cara Siciliano.: \"To begin, I'd like to address a video recorded at Brooks Camp that has recently gone viral.   In case you haven't seen it, the video shows bear 747--the largest adult male at Brooks River--walking within a few feet of a group of people standing on the side of the road near the Brooks Falls trailhead. 747 walks past the group, then turns around near the falls trailhead. Many reactions to the video ranged from surprise to outrage. On the other hand I--having experienced similar situations as a ranger and visitor--had a different response. I was not surprised at all. When asked about it, I initially provided a bit of a muted response. In the video, 747 was stressed. You can hear him jaw-popping when he turned around. His vocalizations and movement could've been a reaction to the presence of people or something else. I'm not sure. One note I would like to add about getting off the trail: While it is important to give bears the right-of-way, it equally important to give bears as much space as possible. That means getting off the trail as far as you can before the bear is close by. However, separating yourself from the bear's space isn't always possible due to the design of trails at Brooks River. The forest behind the group recording the video is quite thick, for example. They might not have had time to move off the road before 747 was too close. In a situation when it doesn't seem like you have time to move away safely, then standing your ground and letting the bear choose how it will avoid you is often a good decision. Situations like these are common at Brooks Camp. With the exception of the wildlife viewing platforms most infrastructure at Brooks Camp, including the trails, are not designed or well placed to separate people from bears. Most bears at Brooks Camp expect to encounter people on trails, though, so sticking to the trails and roads can certainly help increase your safety. Along with staying on designated trails, I encourage anyone who visits Brooks Camp to hike in groups, remain aware of your surroundings to the best of your ability, and plan ahead for what you will do in a surprise encounter. During the mandatory bear orientation at Brooks Camp, rangers emphasize to visitors the importance of giving bears the right-of-way. To do that, it is often necessary to step out of a bear's line of travel as far as you can safely, and take that action as soon as possible. Sometimes that means backing away to a safer location where you can take shelter (a wildlife-viewing platform or building, for example). Sometimes that means stepping off the trail or road with the goal to maintain at least 50 yards of space between you and bear. And, sometimes during a surprise encounter that means getting out of its pathway as best you can, even if that's only a few feet. The first two options are ideal and preferred over the last. So Mike, could the people have moved farther away? Should they have? Maybe, although there are a couple of factors to consider. 1. 747 may have surprised them. They may only have had time to move to the edge of the road. 2. There might have been members of the group who were not physically capable of walking off trail into the forest, even for a short distance. Since I can't see evidence to the contrary in the video, then I think it is appropriate to give their position on the edge of the road the benefit of the doubt. One thing you'll hear in the video is someone repeatedly saying \"Hey bear.\" Talking in a normal tone of voice to your group about what to do is appropriate, of course. It's also appropriate to talk to a bear to inform it that you are a person. However, while it is appropriate to let a bear know you are there, once a bear is aware of your presence you generally do not need to make extra noise as it could provoke a defensive response. Exceptions to this would be if the bear is overtly curious or food-conditioned. Then you'd want to make extra noise. When I discussed the video with Ranger Naomi, she brought up a good point that I should have communicated before. That is, in those situations your priority should not be photographs or video. Focus on the bear's behavior instead, so that you can respond as quickly as possible to any changes. Smart phones aren't to blame here. Trying to record the close proximity of a bear has been in the mindset of people at Brooks Camp for decades. The temptation will be there if you experience it, trust me, so if you are ever in a similar situation reconsider the urge to use your phone or camera. Focus your mind on the bear's actions first and foremost. I also want to make one thing clear: similar scenarios happen many times per day at Brooks River in July and September. That is not an exaggeration. It happens on the trails as well as with anglers and photographers who venture into the river. Brooks River is a loosely regulated bear-viewing site compared to McNeil River, Pack Creek, and Anan Creek. During July there can be hundreds of people at Brooks Camp, dozens of bears using the same area, and far too few rangers to manage it all. The next time a close encounter video goes viral from Brooks Camp, don't be surprised.

This name does not appear in any of the Bears of Brooks River books. It does appear on the KNP&P Flickr Galleries . Ranger Roy Wood provides some insight into how 747 got this nickname Colbert at approximately 23:38 intothis live chat from Luray, Virginia on November 8, 2017 .: Life as a National Park Ranger w Ranger Roy - Brown Bear Live Chat 11 08 17 747's Colbert nickname was inspired by the ear imperfectionhe shares with Stephen Colbert. 747's right ear was a little different than his left ear, it was asymmetrical, it sort of stuck out a little bit. If you watch Stephen Colbert you will see that his ear also has a little outward, downward...it's different from his other ear. 747's misshapen ear was an identification tool the rangers used to identify 747 before he grew into his identification number.Stephen Colbert points out a lot that his ears don't match up, so rangers using Colbert to remind them which bear was 747 when trying to identify the bears probably does not hurt Stephen's feelings.After 747 lost the 2021 Fat Bear Week competition during season 7 of Late Night with Stephen Colbert, Stephen Colbert learned why 747 is nicknamed \"Colbert\" (the 2021 Fat Bear Week segment begins at approximately 8:00 into the video).
