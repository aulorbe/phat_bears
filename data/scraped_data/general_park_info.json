They usually have a PE er \u00e9s ae rounded and dish-shaped face, unlike the faces of black or polar \u2014 i * bears that usually have a more evenly sloping and straighter facial profile. Polar bears and black bears also lack the prominent shoulder hump found on brown bears. This hump contains muscles that add power to their front legs. Brown bears\u2019 strength comes in part from the rigid anchorage of their thick skeleton, and the position and size of their powerful muscles. Extremely thick bones inside their legs and a plantigrade gait (the whole length of each foot\u2014from heel to toe\u2014touches the ground) help support their great weight. Brown bears are aptly named for their color. Their brownish fur comes in a wide variety of shades and hues. The fur of brown bears ranges from blonde to dark brown. Photo courtesy. of A.

Bears eat when they are hungry. They sleep when they are tired. They mate when hormones are right. While instinct influences bear behavior ee (and it may be the major influence), these animals are also highly intelligent. Like other intelligent animals, bears have the ability to adapt, make decisions, and act as individuals. A large male bear steals salmon from smaller bears. Another, a \u2014 equally large male, ignores the salmon smaller bears catch. A big female fishes at Brooks Falls, but the next year when she has cubs, she never ventures within a third of a mile of the falls. An older adult bear, one that has visited Brooks River for years, still flees from approaching anglers in the river. A younger bear, no more than two years removed from its mother, habitually uses the trails within ten yards of Brooks Lodge. One bear does this, another does that. eo. Bear watching at Brooks River is unique, because biologists have gathered an incredible amount of information about how bears use this place. This information allows us to follow the life histories of individual bears using Brooks River, sometimes from a bear\u2019s first year exploring the river to later in its life as a dominant adult bear. Even if you only spend one hour watching bears at Brooks River, it is easy to see how each bear is different. These bears are not only distinguished by physical characteristics, but more importantly, they are also distinguished by their habits and behavior. Each bear is a unique _\u2014 individual. Rarely do we have the opportunity to get to know a group of wild animals as individuals. Bear watching at Brooks River, however, gives us that chance. = You are encouraged to get to know the Brooks River bears as the individuals that they are. This book is an aid to their identification. However, providing the information necessary to identify each bear is not the goal or intention of this book. Most importantly, this book serves as a reference for their life history and behavior. A bear\u2019s life is full of experiences that are unique to that individual. These experiences affect everything from how they fish to where they den to their tolerance of people. \u2014 No matter if you are watching the bears of Brooks River in person or online, take a moment to get to know these animals. The individuality they demonstrate provides great opportunities for us to gain insight into their intelligence and ability to survive in a harsh world.", "Let's Get Fat Excessive weight gain is key to a bear\u2019s survival.

Bears are survivors with a very special adaptation\u2014hibernation\u2014that allows them to survive harsh wintertime conditions and famine 1 remarkably well. j 4 Ar can find a way to hibernate like a bear. mo a When hibernating, a bear\u2019s body temperature remains above 88\u00b0F (31\u00b0C), not much lower than their normal body temperature of 100\u00b0F (37.7\u00b0C). This is unlike other hibernating mammals, such as arctic ground squirrels whose body temperature drops close to freezing. A bear\u2019s heart and respiratory rates, however, drop dramatically. They average only one breath per minute with a heart rate of 8-10 beats per minute in hibernation. They still need to burn many calories per day while hibernating\u2014sometimes more than 4000 calories per day. When they emerge from their dens in the spring, bears have lost up to 33% of their body weight. Lactating females can lose even more weight. Surviving a winter without food or water requires fuel, and a bear fuels its body on the fat reserves it acquired during the previous summer and fall. Bears do not eat, drink, urinate, or defecate while in the den. Fat is metabolized to produce water and food, but instead of defecating or urinating to eliminate waste, bears recycle it. Their kidneys shut down almost completely and urea, a major component of urine, is recycled into proteins that maintain a bear\u2019s muscle mass and organ tissues.

", "Bear Identification Individual bears are difficult to identify, especially the first few times you see them. Bears at Brooks River are not tagged or marked for identification. The information in this book is drawn from thousands of hours of data collection, which is used to document long term patterns of bear use along the river. Face . Brown bears typically have dished-shaped faces (meaning it\u2019s _ often concave from its eyes and along its muzzle). Like humans though, each bear\u2019s face is unique. Look closely at a bear\u2019s face _ to note the shape of its muzzle and the relative position of its eyes. i Fishing Techniques . _ Bears have an instinct to eat high calorie foods like salmon, ~ but fishing is a learned behavior. Not all bears fish in the same way or in the same places. This offers great insight into their individuality. Often no specific feature is diagnostic of any individual bear. Rangers and biologists use a combination of a bear\u2019s physical characteristics, habits, and disposition to identify the animals. Body Size and Shape Overall size and shape are useful identification ed - 4 Fur Color and Shed Pattern characteristics, but bears grow rapidly from season to 7 -l The color of a bear\u2019s fur or coat and the pattern it is shed is season and year to year.

Disposition There are behaviors that all bears share, but not all bears do . ox . the same things in the same way. Some are aggressive towards ee ; \u2014_ other bears. They show other bears how dominant they are. Others avoid confrontation and are more subordinate. Some bears are tolerant of people and others will avoid people at almost all costs. These behavioral characteristics are important differences between each bear. Sex Is it a male or female? Genitalia is usually only visible on adult males. It is harder to see on females and younger bears. If you can\u2019t see a bear\u2019s genitalia, then watch them urinate. Male bears will urinate straight down between their hind legs, while females urinate behind them. This is especially useful when trying to determine the sex of cubs. Ears Bear ears come in a variety of colors, shapes, and sizes. Note if a bear\u2019s ears are large or small, triangular or oval, upright or flopped over. Some bears are even missing all or part of an ear. Generally speaking, the ears on adults are more widely spaced than cubs and subadult bears. Some bears also have very light colored ears, even in the fall. ", "Cub Killer? Infanticide in Bears Do male bears kill cubs? If so, why? The answers are paradoxically simple and complicated. Yes, bears kill cubs, but no one is completely sure why. Female bears have been observed killing cubs as well, so the behavior is not restricted to just males. Infanticide is the term commonly used to describe the killing of a bear cub. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain why bears kill cubs. Increased Reproductive Potential Motivation to mate with a female bear may drive a male to kill her cubs. Biologists describe this behavior as sexually selected infanticide. Female bears won\u2019t enter estrus (\u201cheat\u201d) as long as they are nursing. If a female loses her cubs in spring or early summer, she may enter estrus and become receptive to mating. Food Bears are cannibalistic, so hunger may motivate some bears to kill cubs. Even subadult and small adult female bears fall victim to predatory attacks by larger bears. Reduced Competition Perhaps some bears view cubs as potential competitors in the future. Through infanticide, a bear can eliminate a competitor at its weakest point. These ideas have merit, but there is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d explanation for this behavior. Each idea proposed has evidence to contradict it. Cubs are sometimes killed and not eaten. If a bear kills a cub to reduce competition, that may require a level of forethought and intelligence in bears that has yet to be scientifically demonstrated. Even the idea of sexually selected infanticide has issues. Bears are promiscuous. There is no . a : - Bre yy\u2019 i - ty a >) <; \u201d ~~. | 7 guarantee that an infanticidal male will sire another litter with the mother, nor is there any guarantee that the male bear would even have access to the female. A more dominant male could appropriate the female for himself. Even though few infanticides have been witnessed at Brooks River, they occur during spring, summer, and fall\u2014not just during the mating season which peaks in late spring. Female bears kill cubs too, which does not support the idea of sexually selected infanticide either. Infanticide may be difficult to reconcile from a human point of view, but bears exist and behave outside of our moral and ethical boundaries. This is a behavior that will continue among Katmai\u2019s bears as long as they remain wild creatures, and it is a behavior we may never be able to fully understand or explain.

Patterns of use along Brooks River reflect bears\u2019 ability to learn and adapt to changing conditions\u2014traits that help them survive extreme contrasts between seasons of abundance and famine. Springtime is a lean season for bears who live in the interior of Katmai National Park and Preserve. Little food is typically available to bears in the spring, so they are dispersed throughout the area and are only infrequently seen at Brooks Camp in May and June. At this time of the year bears are focused on eating grass and sedge, hunting moose calves, and competing for mates. When salmon begin to arrive in late June, bears migrate to Brooks River. Bears can be seen fishing at Brooks Falls and in the lower Brooks River through July. Mid-July is typically when the largest number of bears can be seen along the river. After that, bears slowly begin to disperse to other areas. In August, salmon are beginning to spawn in Brooks River, but \u201c7 . \u201cwe ol, <y, sel, Ln oe oe 4 I : fl 2 PSN oh te oh ht they are less concentrated, remain energetic, and are no longer migrating. This creates difficult fishing conditions for bears and almost all of the bears will leave the area. Like June, there can be days in August when no bears are seen at Brooks Camp. For the bears, salmon fishing is easier in other places. However, for the past five years, there have been increased numbers of salmon and subsequently bears in the Brooks Camp area in August. By late August, many salmon have already spawned and will begin to die. As the fish weaken and die, bears migrate back to Brooks River to feed. In September, bears are usually present in high numbers as they search for dead and dying salmon. In the fall, bear numbers usually peak by the first week in October. ? . |.

Each summer tens of millions of sockeye salmon leave the North Pacific, driven by instinct to return to the exact spawning grounds where they hatched years earlier. For several hundred thousand salmon the path leads up Brooks River. Near the summer solstice, sockeye salmon begin migrating into Naknek River from Bristol Bay. From there, salmon swim into Naknek Lake and reach Brooks River. This is the final stop for some fish; here they will spawn and die. For others, the voyage is not quite over. Their destination lies beyond Brooks River, in the small tributaries of Lake Brooks. Sockeye salmon reach sexual maturity when they approach their spawning grounds. Their silver color disappears, replaced by red-colored bodies and green heads. They also attain humped backs, elongated jaws and prominent teeth. These features are especially pronounced in male salmon. Using their tails, female sockeye excavate a series of nests, collectively called a redd, in the river bottom. Males don\u2019t dig nests, but they fight with other males for access to females. When a female judges a nest to be just right, she releases eggs in it. Simultaneously, the attending male fertilizes the eggs with milt. Then the female buries the eggs in gravel. Once spawning is complete, a female will defend her redd as long as she can. Male salmon move on and may attempt to fertilize the eggs of other females. After spawning though, salmon are on borrowed time. Spawned-out and with their life purpose complete, they will never return to the ocean. They slowly weaken and die. Eggs incubate for about four months. After hatching, the tiny larval fish, called alevin, remain in the gravel until they emerge as fry in spring. When large enough, young sockeye fry move from streams to lakes, where they stay for one to two years. Salmon fry become smolt when they begin to migrate downstream to the ocean. Salmon smolt imprint on their natal streams and lakes while migrating to the ocean. Along this journey, they undergo many physiological changes to prepare for a saltwater existence. Salmon smolt are about to enter a totally new environment, whose conditions they cannot know until they get there. Substantial changes to the kidneys and gills are required for the fish to survive the harsh transition from freshwater to the salty ocean. Sockeye salmon feast in the North Pacific for two additional Spawning sockeye salmon look far different compared to those who ETS.

Is it their importance to brown bears? Is it the commercial and recreational fishing opportunities they provide? Is it the promise of food through a long winter? What about their epic migrations and battle against the odds? Of course, all of these things make them interesting and important. For amoment though, consider how salmon are important in other ways that might not be obvious. Salmon are conveyor belts of energy and nutrients. They are the keystone that turns impoverished land and water into productive and vibrant landscapes. Salmon provide the energy necessary for bears to grow large and fat over the summer and fall. Katmai\u2019s bears are larger and experience higher reproductive rates compared to bears without salmon in their diet. Salmon also provide food for dozens of other species, including fish and invertebrates. Many different fish species gorge on salmon fry and smolt in the spring and salmon eggs in the fall. Anglers often catch arctic char and rainbow trout with stomachs visibly distended with salmon eggs. In the winter, these fish may not eat much at all. They, like bears, are surviving on the energy brought to them by salmon. Even decomposing salmon are vital to the ecosystem. Dead salmon provide nitrogen and phosphorus that fertilize nutrient poor freshwater lakes and streams. These nutrients boost the primary productivity of plankton, which in turn feed salmon fry. Without this yearly boost, streams and lakes could not support high numbers of salmon fry. Riparian vegetation also grows quicker along salmon streams. What would the loss of salmon mean for a place like Brooks River? Most people come to watch bears and fish for trophy-sized trout, grayling, and char. Without salmon, Brooks River would not be a world famous fishing destination, because there would be no large fish to catch. Without salmon, no one would visit Brooks Camp to see bears, because no bears would gather here. For thousands of years, people fished at Brooks Falls for salmon too. Even today, salmon are the heartbeat of the area\u2019s culture and economy. Without salmon, the economy of Bristol Bay and Southwest Alaska would collapse. . ae \u201c \u2018 - ee . ee .* t. ; a The survival of the modern day Katmai experience, the ecosystem as we\u2019ve known it, and the history of Brooks River is intimately tied to these fish.

To protect that experience for future generations, the National Park Service requires all arriving visitors to attend a 20-minute bear orientation and safety talk. This \u201cbear school\u201d teaches visitors how to behave in ways to help protect both themselves and bears. While at Brooks Camp, it is necessary for all of us to follow these simple guidelines: * Keep an appropriate distance between yourself and bears: Stay at least 50 yards (~46 meters) away from all bears in the Brooks Camp area. * Prevent bears from obtaining human food and garbage: At Brooks Camp, bears do not associate people with food. To keep bears and people safe, do not carry or consume food and drinks (besides water) while outside, except in designated picnic areas. * Prevent bears from associating human gear with play items: While at Brooks Camp, any items brought outdoors must be kept within arm\u2019s reach at all times. Bears are naturally curious, intelligent, and playful animals who may investigate unattended property and learn to associate human objects with play rewards. * Bears have the right of way: If you encounter a bear, you should give it the space it needs to continue fishing, walking, or sleeping. This may mean altering your behavior by stopping fishing, moving out of a bears line of travel by stepping off trail, or waiting until a bear has finished sleeping before continuing to your destination. At times, bears may block access to areas such as the viewing platforms. Pack your patience and remember the bears\u2019 freedom is what makes Brooks Camp an exciting destination. - Avoid surprise encounters: Remain alert and watch for bears. Hike and walk in groups. Talk with your group so that bears hear your approach. By visiting Katmai, we are entering the bears\u2019 home. We have the privilege of observing these wild animals in their natural La habitat. It is important to ensure that our behavior remains consistent around bears.

Inevitably, some bears acquire nicknames from staff and these nicknames are included in this book, but naming wild animals is not without controversy. Is it appropriate to name wild animals? Personnel at many bear watching areas in Alaska, like Brooks River, attach nicknames to frequently seen bears. These serve to help people identify, track, and manage the animals. However, names undoubtedly alter the way in which we relate to an animal.

What stigmas would you attach to a young bear nicknamed Fluffy versus a large male bear named Killer? How would those stigmas alter your experience when watching that animal? With those questions in mind, assigned numbers are certainly more neutral than a name, but over time a number may lead to just as much anthropomorphizing as a nickname. No matter how we relate to these animals though, at Brooks River the bears with nicknames remain wild animals.

What data are collected? > Observation sessions are scheduled to produce balanced sampling by time of day and sample zone. Biologists collect a wide variety of information during bear monitoring sessions. They note the number of bears present along the river, identify individual bears and document their characteristics, record behavior and activity, and count the number of people present. Counts of From year to year, records of identifying characteristics of individual bears are maintained, and each bear identified is assigned a unique identification number. The age (adult or subadult) and sex of each bear is also recorded. Age classification is a subjective determination, based primarily on size and behavior (and often on the documented identification history of the bear). Sex is determined by observation of urination, posture, genitalia, or presence of offspring. Photo records are maintained for as many different individuals as possible. The photo records are an important aspect of recognizing individual bears across seasons and years, particularly when several biologists are involved in data collection. ", "How Many Bears Use Brooks River? High numbers of bears at Brooks River may be a relatively new phenomenon in Katmai National Park\u2019s recent history. Archeological excavations reveal evidence of extensive human use on the river for thousands of years. During much of this time, humans and bears directly competed for access to salmon. When humans gathered at Brooks Falls to fish, bears may have been displaced. After the establishment of Katmai National Monument in 1918, and especially after the monument was expanded to include the Brooks River area in 1931, bears were granted a high level of protection. Even so, anecdotal evidence suggests that Katmai\u2019s bear population was at an ebb in the 1950s. Since then, the number of bears using Brooks River has greatly increased. Why? Abundant salmon are likely the reason for this trend. Bear survival and productivity is directly linked to salmon. About 20% of the Naknek River\u2019s salmon escapement migrate to Brooks River. Also, over the past 30 years, Katmai\u2019s bear management policies have placed increasing emphasis on minimizing bear-human conflicts. Bear cubs that accompany their mothers to Brooks River typically experience relatively benign contacts with people. Thus, as these cubs grow into adults we would expect the number and proportion of adults tolerant of people to increase. In the 1970s, very few bears used Brooks River in July (usually not more than 6-8 bears) while 25-40 bears used Brooks River in the fall during that same time, but in the 1980s, bears began to fish at Brooks Falls during July in ever increasing numbers. By the early 2000s, bear numbers in July surpassed bear numbers in the fall. Bear numbers also differ from season to season. Brooks River is one of the first streams in Katmai where migrating salmon become accessible to bears (and the caloric value of bright pre-spawned salmon is exceptionally high). In contrast, spawning and spawned-out salmon are available at several streams during the fall. How many bears use the river now? During late June through July, the annual cumulative total number of independent bears identified regularly using Brooks River during 2001-2021 has ranged from 32 to 80. During fall (September through early October), the annual cumulative total of bears has ranged from 28 to 83. Typically, another 5 to 10 transient bears are documented in each of the two monitoring periods annually. In 2021, 76 individual bears were identified in July and 62 in fall.

Once they learn when and where , food is available, they will return to those places again and again. Since Brooks River typically offers reliable access to salmon, many of the bears seen at Brooks River each year are recognized from : prior years. Some bears use the river every year of their life. = The majority of newly recognized bears are subadult bears who are establishing their own home ranges and experiencing life away from their mother for the first time. However, almost every year a few mature adult bears who are unknown to park staff visit the river. Some are transient; they stay for only short periods of time and are never seen again. Others are persuaded to stay and fish for salmon in subsequent years. The \u201ccast\u201d of bears seen on the river each season is relatively consistent. For example, during 2007, an unsually active year with over 100 different bears, 50 of the 69 independent bears identified on the Brooks River in July were recognized from previous years. Similarly, 34 of the 45 independent bears identified during fall were recognized from previous seasons. Recognizing bears from year to year is difficult; therefore, these figures should be considered minimum estimates. \u20ac Each year, a number of bears are also recognized between the periods of July and fall bear use at Brooks River. Recognizing bears between July and fall, within a single year can be very difficult. Bears that can\u2019t be re-identified are assigned new three-digit numbers. * #402 first came to Brooks River with her mother in the late 1990s. She has returned every year since. Top photo shows #402 as a 3.5 year-old subadult in 2001. Bottom photo is from 2021. 23", "Predator and Prey at Brooks River What might cause bear abundance to vary at Brooks River? This is a tale of predator and prey over years, months, and minutes. Comparing overall bear numbers with salmon escapement reveals a long term relationship. Escapement is the number of fish not captured by commercial fishing and migrating inland to spawn. The number of bears at Brooks River has risen and fallen over the past years and seems to closely parallel a rise and decline in salmon abundance. Large runs of salmon support greater numbers of bears and increase reproduction rates. Like many predator-prey relationships though, predator numbers lag behind prey abundance. Since the late 1990s, rangers at Brooks Falls have counted bears, salmon, and people at Brooks Falls. From late June to early August, staff record individual bears seen at the river near the falls and the number of people standing on the Brooks Falls wildlife viewing platform. Jumping salmon also are counted for one minute to document their relative abundance. This data is collected every half hour from approximately 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. As the number of sockeye salmon migrating through Brooks River increases, bear numbers too steadily increase. 8 \u2122=\"Average Fish Jumping 40 Bear numbers at Brooks Falls also vary considerably on a day to day, hour to hour, time scale. During extreme highs in salmon abundance, fish are so plentiful and easy to catch that many bears are satiated quickly. At these moments, bears spend less time fishing, because they get full and move out of the water to rest. When lesser numbers of salmon are seen at the falls, bears often spend more time fishing and more bears are seen. When you watch salmon and bears at Brooks Falls, look for these patterns to emerge. It\u2019s a real life drama of predator and prey. 35 30 25 20 15 Average Fish Observed Seyy ay 10 Average Number of Bears Observed June-July . . oe .'\\ \u201c Figure 1.

These deaths highlighted a major risk that all organisms face\u2014infectious disease. In Katmai, a place with some of the highest densities of bears anywhere in the world, rangers and biologists rarely see a bear die or find dead bears. Still, the information about the few recorded bear deaths can help us glean some knowledge about the end of a bear\u2019s life. During the past 36 years at Brooks River, only about 15 bear deaths have been documented. Almost all of these deaths were caused by other bears, but illness and disease will take its toll. On October 21, 2015, bear cam viewers watched a mother bear (#451) and her two spring cubs. One of the cubs stumbled as it walked. The cub collapsed at the base of the viewing platform near one of the cams. For two and a half days, it remained there. #451 and her other cub remained nearby for most of this time before it died on October 23. The cub was collected for necropsy on Saturday, October 24. SAPD. aN yA Wildlife technicians examined #451's dead cub for visible signs of trauma before collecting it. A few hours after the dead cub was retrieved, webcam viewers noticed a large, brown, stationary object at the lake shore near where the cub died. It did not move in the following days. Due to its size, color, and location, park staff believed it was a dead bear. Since the possibility for a disease outbreak or human-caused deaths existed, park staff returned to Brooks River, conducted a gross field necropsy, and sent samples to a lab for further analysis. When they returned, they identified the bear as #868. Results from a laboratory analysis indicate that the cub likely died from canine adenovirus type-I (CAV-1). This disease is also called canine infectious hepatitis. Infectious canine hepatitis is a viral disease found worldwide that primarily infects dogs, foxes, wolves, coyotes, and bears. A 1998 study documented about 10% of brown bears on the Alaska Peninsula had the antibodies that indicate they had contact with the virus. The tissue samples from the cub tested negative for rabies and canine distemper. Analysis was conducted by USGS staff at the National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC). e355\" . 3 : i ee Pe i i ind - <a es - #868's body was examined and necropsied in the field. He was estimated to weigh 900 pounds. #868\u2019s cause of death is undetermined. No signs of outward trauma were visible on him, except for a broken nose (the nose could have been broken when he collapsed to the ground). 10-12 gallons of fluid were present in his abdominal cavity, which is not a normal finding. #868 tested negative for CAV-1 and rabies. No parasites were observed in the tongue or abdominal cavity fluid. It appears that his death is unrelated to the cub\u2019s, but there is no evidence that he died from a sudden, traumatic injury. However, samples from 868 were decomposing rapidly by the time they reached the lab for analysis which prevent us from ever knowing his cause of death. For more information on these deaths, see photos of the field necropsy on #868 and photos of the cub when it was collected, and delve into more information of other causes of bear mortality in Katmai. ~ eae? re yr, <_< ae _ ae - \u2018- \u00bb 25", "Brown Bear Genetics Study Brooks Camp offers a unique opportunity to scientists who want the Aleutian Range?

The but enough for it to be statistically important. There are several possible reasons for this, it could be that the Aleutian Range creates a physical barrier between the two populations, or there is no reason to travel through the Range where little food is available compared to locations on the coast and Brooks Camp that have high concentrations of food while the Range itself does not, or it could be for other reasons. Overall, the bear population at Katmai was shown to be genetically healthy and diverse, with greater genetic diversity than other populations in North America.
